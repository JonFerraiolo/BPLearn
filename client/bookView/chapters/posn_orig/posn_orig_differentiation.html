<p class="noindent">You not only need to sell your solution to your target audience&#x2019;s problem, but you need to set yourself apart as <em>the</em> best person to deliver that solution. Start with your expertise. If you don&#x2019;t have it, get it. Take classes, read, engage with experts, do pro bono work.</p>
<h3><strong>Share your knowledge and be known for something of value.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Jeremy is a manager of data collection and metrics for a large software company. He is concerned about losing his job and wants to go from expendable to irreplaceable. He has assets that can help to distinguish himself but has not communicated them effectively. Jeremy has an MBA degree and marries business understanding with his technical understanding from his information technology background. This combined background enables him to provide the data that answers Marketing&#x2019;s strategic questions about campaigns. He needs to leverage his data collection systems expertise with his unique methodology for ensuring the right data is collected. By doing so, he will move his positioning from being a cog in a wheel to a key employee who adds strategic value.</p>
