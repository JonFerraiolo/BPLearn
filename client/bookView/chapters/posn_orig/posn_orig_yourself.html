<p class="noindent">Bob and Mike are software programmers in their fifties. Years ago, they were both at the top of their field in graphics software for the desktop.</p>
<p class="noindent">Bob was confident his programming skills that got him to where he was today would carry him through to retirement. He was wrong. The technology landscape changed with mobile and browser-based computing. He was laid off from his job and could not find a new one because he was branded as &#x201C;old school.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">Mike, however, constantly kept a sharp eye on maintaining his unique value to his field&#x2014;that is, his cake. At different intervals in his career, he asked, &#x201C;What are the big-picture trends in the industry, in technology and in my company? What can I do to take advantage of changes in my environment?&#x201D; Mike learned about new technologies, developed relationships with leading technologists and gained a reputation as a visionary. When it came time to look for a new job, he got two excellent offers from leading technology companies.</p>
<p class="noindent">Today, Mike is recognized at his company and in the industry as a leader in graphical web software. Unlike Bob, who is unemployed, Mike positioned himself for new opportunities.</p>
