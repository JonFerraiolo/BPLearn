<h4 class="h4" id="h2_11"><span class="gray">Evidence: How can you prove it?</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Here is where you show that you&#x2019;re not all talk. Find examples. Look back through your professional experience, and see what relates to what you are promising. What you&#x2019;ve done in the past can translate into evidence of how you can deliver solutions. This can require some creative thinking&#x2014;and looking at your experience in a new way. What you&#x2019;ve done in one area can translate into meaningful proof of what you can deliver in another.</p>
<p class="noindent">Marnie wanted to transition from a 20-year career in retail fashion sales to getting a job in the elder care industry, a move that would satisfy her soul. How could she be a credible job candidate when she hadn&#x2019;t done any professional work in the industry in decades? What was her evidence?</p>
<p><a id="page52" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Her initial goal was a sales job with companies providing home care for seniors. To show her interest in elder care, she volunteered as a pet therapist with Alzheimer&#x2019;s patients, joined elder care networking groups and worked as a caregiver for an elderly patient. For evidence of her sales and service capability, she highlighted her Customer Service All-Star award for a leading retailer and promoted her excellent sales record of achievement. Finally, she demonstrated professional knowledge by talking about her early career experience as a social worker for elder care facilities and her college degrees in psychology and counseling. Her caring nature came through as she discussed how she had taken care of her mother, a longtime Parkinson&#x2019;s patient, in her mom&#x2019;s final years.</p>
<p class="noindent">We helped Marnie to differentiate herself and package her assets in a way that spoke to the needs of her target audience, overcoming whatever prejudices they might have had about her long career in retail fashion sales. The result? Marnie got multiple interviews, and is working in elder care sales with a leading home care company.</p>
<p class="noindent">To use the famous rubber-band analogy, create your goals far enough above what you are doing now to keep the rubber band taut. If it&#x2019;s slack, your aspirations may be too low&#x2014;you may not be growing as you should. But don&#x2019;t set your sights so far away from your present reality that the rubber band breaks. Likewise, it&#x2019;s okay to stretch how skills in one area can apply to evidence in another. Just don&#x2019;t break the rubber band. If you stretch too much, you won&#x2019;t be credible.</p>
<h3><strong>You can&#x2019;t develop a sustainable new personal brand based on smoke and mirrors.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you are light on evidence, you now know where to start. What can you do here and now&#x2014;from your current position, or lack of one&#x2014;to show you can deliver solutions to your target audience? If you want to be known as an innovator, what are you doing now as proof that is the case? Don&#x2019;t have the opportunity to show that potential where you are now? Think outside the cubicle. Volunteer. Teach. Get involved in community groups where you can bring out the characteristics you want to shine. These quickly become evidence of what you can offer in a professional context.</p>
