<h4 class="h4" id="h2_8"><span class="gray">Problem or Opportunity Statement: What do <em>they</em> need?</span></h4>
<h3><strong>In positioning, we are either solving a problem or enabling an opportunity. Sometimes it&#x2019;s both.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">In defining the problem statement, ask: What is the main problem my target audience faces? What are their challenges that I can address? Only when you understand these well can you start to position yourself as part of the solution. Otherwise you might be a perfect solution, but to the wrong problem&#x2014;a problem your target audience doesn&#x2019;t happen to have.</p>
<p class="noindent">Do you recall Eileen, our product marketing director who wanted to be promoted as a vice president? She chose her boss, the Senior VP of Marketing, as her target audience. However, her target audience should have been the executive leadership team who would have to promote her as a peer, and whose needs were different from the pain points of the VP of Marketing. By choosing the wrong target audience, her positioning strategy for becoming a vice president would be less effective. As Eileen&#x2019;s example points out, the target audience, problem statement and value proposition are intricately linked.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are looking for a job and don&#x2019;t have an insider&#x2019;s view of what your target audience needs, do your homework. Ask friends in that field. Do a Google search on the company. Look them up in Yahoo Finance. Business analyst reports are a great way to see where companies&#x2019; weak spots are. Go to LinkedIn and look at the backgrounds of the targets with whom you might be interviewing. Where might they be feeling insecure? For instance, say you are interviewing with a VP of Marketing who has spent most of his career <a id="page50" />on the technical and sales side and may feel inadequate as a marketer. You can position yourself as a strong career marketer who empowers teams with marketing skills transfer.</p>
<p class="noindent">Never underestimate the importance of this step. How can you begin to position yourself as the answer to someone&#x2019;s problem if you aren&#x2019;t clear on who that person is and what the person&#x2019;s problems are? Ask yourself: what kind of cake is your audience hungry for?</p>
