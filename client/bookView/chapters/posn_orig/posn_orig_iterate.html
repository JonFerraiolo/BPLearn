<h2 id="h2_14"><span class="gray">Iterate to Hone Your Positioning</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Iteration is key to making your positioning statement crisp and compelling. If you change the target audience, the problem statement changes and, hence, <a id="page58" />the value proposition. Conversely, you may have a great value proposition but if it doesn&#x2019;t match the audience&#x2019;s needs, you need to find a new target audience that will value what you have to offer.</p>
<h3><strong>The key to great positioning is putting yourself in the shoes of the audience that you are trying to reach.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">For product companies, the key is understanding the consumer. For those looking for a job, it is understanding the needs of the hiring manager. For the entrepreneur looking for funding, it is understanding the needs of investors. If you have a skill that is unique to you but no one is interested, it doesn&#x2019;t matter that it is unique. You have to be <em>relevant</em> and unique.</p>
