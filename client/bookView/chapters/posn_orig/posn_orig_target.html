<h2 id="h2_7"><span class="gray">Who Is Your Target Audience?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">It&#x2019;s important to have a distinct audience in mind because otherwise you will try to be all things to all people, and your positioning will be too general and undifferentiated.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think about your target audience first. Who are they? If your goal is to land a great job with a hot new company, that company, your future boss and the HR team are your target audiences. If you&#x2019;re working toward a promotion or new position in your current company, your would-be boss or group executive is your target audience. If you are an entrepreneur looking for venture capital, your prospective venture capitalists represent your target audiences.</p>
<p class="noindent">What if you have different audiences with different needs? You can always write different positioning statements to help you message to the different audiences. However, your overall positioning category should remain <a id="page49" />the same if your target audiences talk to one another. You need to put a stake in the ground to be known for something. It&#x2019;s understandable if you position differently for different job opportunities, but once in a job, keep your positioning the same until you decide to change for strategic reasons. If you flit from one positioning category to another, your positioning will be unclear. People will not consider you for opportunities without a clear understanding of how you are positioned to add value.</p>
