<h4 class="h4" id="h2_9"><span class="gray">Value Proposition: How can <em>you</em> provide the solution?</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Now, only after a thorough review of your audience and its needs, is the time to think about you. What do you have to offer <em>in relation to your audience&#x2019;s needs?</em> How can you be a real part of the solution? Perhaps you can add some muscle to their weakest parts and make <em>them</em> look like heroes. This is your value proposition.</p>
<p class="noindent">An innovative American company was acquired by a large conservative European firm with a more formal corporate culture and less diverse workforce. The executives of the San Francisco company were concerned that with recent leadership changes, management looked less diverse, especially in the area of engineering. Celia, a process engineer, was able to differentiate herself by adding diversity leader to her positioning and leveraging her role as president of a national organization of female engineers. She became an asset to the executive team as they looked to raise the visibility of the company as an inclusive employer.</p>
<p class="noindent">When applying for a job, <em>every</em> applicant will say he or she is a skilled programmer, accountant, manager&#x2014;or whatever the title may be. That is a given. But what is your cake that adds differentiating value?</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are interviewing with a company that is light on experience, and you&#x2019;ve got a lot, emphasize your lengthy track record. If the opposite is true, emphasize your fresh perspective.</p>
<p class="noindent">How can you help them reduce burdensome costs? Boost lagging sales? Change their culture? Find a pain point that your particular audience has today, and show how you can be&#x2014;or at least be an important part of&#x2014;the cure.</p>
