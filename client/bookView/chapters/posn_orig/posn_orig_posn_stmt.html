<h2 id="h2_6"><span class="gray">Positioning Statement</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The triangulation exercise has prepared you for writing your positioning statement, the first step in the BrandingPays System. This statement is a tool to help you to ensure that you have a unique and compelling value proposition for a particular target audience.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that we &#x201C;bake the cake, then ice it.&#x201D; The cake is your positioning. This is the foundation for a strong brand. Without it, your brand would be all fluff, or icing&#x2014;not very substantial or credible.</p>
<h3><strong>The positioning statement provides the foundation for developing your elevator pitch and key value messages for different audiences.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">It will also provide input to the Brand Strategy Platform (<a href="chapter004.xhtml">chapter 4</a>), where we put your cake and icing together.</p>
<p class="noindent">Despite popular belief, your positioning statement is not your elevator pitch. Elements of your positioning statement, however, will be used in your elevator pitch and key messages, which we&#x2019;ll explore in <a href="chapter003.xhtml">chapter 3</a>.</p>
<p><a id="page47" /></p>
<p class="noindent">See <a href="#fig2.3">Figure 2.3</a> for our positioning statement template. There are five positioning elements that we need to consider:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Target Audience</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Problem Statement</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Category</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Value Proposition</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Competitive Differentiation</p>

<p class="noindent">Geoffrey Moore, the author of <em>Crossing the Chasm</em> and a fellow Regis McKenna partner, did the business world a great service when he developed the positioning statement format that is basically a run-on sentence that goes:</p>
<p class="noindent"><span class="orange">For (target audience)<br/>Who needs or wants (problem statement)<br/>Our product is a (category)<br/>That (value proposition)<br/>Unlike (key competitor), our product is &#x2026; (competitive differentiation)</span></p>
<p class="noindent">The beauty of this format is that it is a great way to ensure you understand your audience&#x2019;s needs and message your value in a compelling way.</p>
<p class="noindent">When applied to personal branding, you are the &#x201C;product&#x201D; in the positioning statement.</p>
<h3><strong>Thinking of yourself as a product may help you to see yourself and your opportunities objectively.</strong></h3>
