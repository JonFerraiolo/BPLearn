<h2 id="h2_4"><span class="gray">What Is Your Goal?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Before defining your positioning, let&#x2019;s identify your career or opportunity goal. Having such a goal is very important in personal branding. If you have a career goal, it will help to guide you in making choices about your desired brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are currently a director and want to become a vice president, perhaps you will have to position yourself from a group leader to an effective company leader. Think back to Eileen, the marketing director who wanted to be promoted to vice president. She needed to demonstrate not only her strategic leadership capability, but also her ability to align her personal brand values with the company&#x2019;s new culture.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unless they are self-funded, entrepreneurs need to find investors who believe in their companies to reach their dreams. Their goal is not getting a job; it is getting the company funded. Entrepreneurs have to understand what investors value and position their companies in a way that meets investor needs.</p>
<p class="noindent">Often MBA students are getting their degree with the hope of switching careers, say from hardware engineering to marketing. If you are an engineer, your first goal out of the MBA program should not be a consumer marketing position. It&#x2019;s just too great a leap of faith to go from being a hardware engineer to, say, marketing breakfast cereals. It would make more sense to set your sights on a marketing job at a technology company where you could leverage your engineering background.</p>
<p class="noindent">When choosing your goals, you need to be somewhat realistic. Doing a 180-degree turn in personality or skill set is difficult to achieve. Let&#x2019;s say your goal is to become a company CEO but you are shy and feel uncomfortable speaking in public. Either your goal needs to change or your personality needs an overhaul, because shyness and feeling ill at ease speaking publicly is not a winning combination for being a CEO. You might consider altering your career goal to something that is more within reach.</p>
