</div>
<p class="noindent">As Karen Kang notes in her introduction, she and I were principals and later partners at Regis McKenna Inc. during the 1980s and early 1990s. This was a seminal time for high-tech marketing, and RMI was at the epicenter, in large part because Regis&#x2019;s book, <em>The Regis Touch,</em> laid out a whole new game plan for how to bring high-tech products to market.</p>
<p class="noindent">Fast forward to 2013. This is another seminal time, this time for marketing &#x201C;companies of one,&#x201D; or, more specifically, you. In the new business order, everyone is a contractor all the time. To be sure, you may at present be giving 100 percent of your capacity to a single client&#x2014;your employer&#x2014;but that in no way lessens your self-marketing responsibilities. Your boss is your primary client. Your colleagues are partners in your value chain. The company&#x2019;s customers are your customer&#x2019;s customers. And your job is to communicate to all these constituencies who you are, what you do, and why that is of value to them. Hence the rise of personal branding, and specifically what Karen calls &#x201C;strategic personal branding.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">This is not an exercise in egotism. In a funny way, this is not even about you. Rather, it is about establishing relationships within an ecosystem for the benefit of all participating. That is why Karen&#x2019;s experience at RMI is so relevant and valuable. This is what lay at the heart of redefining high-tech marketing. It was not about the product&#x2014;it was about the <em>whole product,</em> the complete set of products and services that met the target customer&#x2019;s compelling reason to buy. Karen has taken this entire suite of intellectual property and further developed and repurposed it to serve a new constituency in a new era.</p>
<p class="noindent">Your job is to embrace the challenge of personal branding and to leverage the models and methods this book lays out to position yourself to provide maximum value to others. That, in turn, will create maximum value for you, both in terms of personal fulfillment and financial success. But it is only available to those who step up to the self-marketing challenge. The new business order does not in general have time or patience to discover the real you. You must take the lead here, regardless of how extroverted or introverted you may be. It is simply part of your job.</p>
<p class="noindent"><em>BrandingPays</em> gives you a comprehensive, proven approach to succeeding in this task. It was developed on behalf of start-ups and entrepreneurs, and that is how it asks you to think of yourself. As your teacher and cheerleader, Karen guides you every step of the way. With any luck, putting these practices to work will make for a better world and a happier you. To that end, you have my very best wishes.</p>
