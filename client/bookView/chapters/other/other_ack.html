<p class="noindent">I am grateful to so many people who have helped me throughout my career and, more recently, with their support for this book.</p>
<p class="noindent">As many writers come to realize, writing can be a lonely profession. There were dark days when I wondered if this book would ever see the light of day. Without the love and support of my husband, Jon Ferraiolo, I don&#x2019;t think the book would have ever happened. My three adult daughters, Nikki, Natalie and Allie, were a constant source of inspiration with their own branding journeys and the authentic way they lead their lives. My sister, Valerie, inspired me with her career transformation, and my brother, Steve, gave me his support and valuable feedback.</p>
<p class="noindent">I am deeply indebted to Karla Olson, my book shepherd, who was instrumental in guiding my writing and setting up the book production and distribution. While working with me, Karla actually used the BrandingPays&#x2122; System to get her dream job as Director of Patagonia Books. She introduced me to Marika Flatt and her excellent team at PR by the Book, who have handled my book publicity. Helen Chang helped me craft the original outline for my book, which was the boost I needed to write the book.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page199" />I would like to express my gratitude to early readers of the book for their feedback and support: Carol Anglin, Claire Chang, Larry Chang, Seymour Duncker, Steven Kang, Leonard Lodish, Meta Mehling, Cristina Nogueira, Rene Shimada Siegal, Ellen Taverner and Satya Krishnaswamy.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thank you &#x2026;</p>
<p class="noindent">To those who have shared their stories with me: Doreen Woo Ho, Modesta Garcia, Randy Paynter, Michael Dreyfus, Lisa Hammann, Caryn McDowell, Kate Kendall, Murat Wahab, Monica Poindexter, Roxanne de la Riva, Siddika Demir, Gisela Paulsen, Greg Chung, Hillary Freeman and many others unnamed.</p>
<p class="noindent">To my friends, colleagues and clients at Humpal, Leftwich &#x0026; Sinn, Tycer-Fultz-Bellack and Regis McKenna Inc., who helped me to develop as a leader and consultant, and showed me what fun business can be. Dan Bellack, thank you for being a great boss and mentor. Don Kobrin, thanks for the decades of lunches that have challenged and inspired me. Susan Faraone, thanks for your friendship and support. Paul Sinn and Mark Galarneau, thanks for teaching me about good design.</p>
<p class="noindent">To Regis McKenna for being a mentor and a model for visionary thinking.</p>
<p class="noindent">To Geoffrey Moore for paving the way with <em>Crossing the Chasm,</em> and making me believe I could make a difference with my book.</p>
<p class="noindent">To Leslie Guidice and Stacy Guidice at Energy Energy Design for their great visual designs for BrandingPays and more than a decade of collaboration on client brands.</p>
<p class="noindent">To Debra Kopelman, Tanja Miller and Don Kraft for believing in my personal branding methodology and setting up the successful seminar series at Genentech.<a id="page200" /></p>
<p class="noindent">To others who have helped along the way: Susan Lucas-Conwell, Raj Setty, Tamiko Wong, Adam Helweh, Shiva Kumar, Carol Pecora, Will Price, Steve Morozumi, Pinky Cheung, Jack Koch and my wonderful clients, who teach me new things every day.</p>
