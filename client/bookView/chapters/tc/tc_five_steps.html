	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>Most of us want to start with tactics. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>Implementing something feels like we&#x2019;re taking action. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>It&#x2019;s the reason why millions of professionals are flocking to social media&#x2014;often without a clue as to why.</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='48'><strong>Posting on social media or going to more networking events without a clear strategy is an example of &#x201C;hurry up and wait.&#x201D;</strong></a></h3>
<p class="noindent"><a data-bp-start-time='51'>You&#x2019;ll get out there faster, but if the world isn&#x2019;t clear on what value your brand delivers, then the confusion you create will only serve to slow adoption of your brand.</a>
