	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>&#x201C;What does a political race have to do with personal branding and my goal of getting a job or investor funding?&#x201D; you may ask.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>Whether competing in politics, in the job market or against other entrepreneurs, you need to stand out and prove that you are the best choice&#x2014;just like a political candidate.</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='6'><strong>The perfect storm of extreme competition for jobs and the explosion of social media has propelled personal branding from a &#x201C;nice to have&#x201D; to a &#x201C;got to do.&#x201D;</strong></a></h3>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>For professionals, a strong personal brand is the key to influence, opportunities and advancement.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>For recent graduates, personal brands can be the difference between getting a job and ending up in the circular file.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>For entrepreneurs, a personal brand that inspires confidence can be the edge that propels investors to fund you.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>Yet many people haven&#x2019;t a clue as to what personal branding is or what to do to achieve a brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>Many think that personal branding is merely cosmetic.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>There&#x2019;s a saying that goes, &#x201C;You can put lipstick on a pig, but it&#x2019;s still a pig.&#x201D;</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>This is true of personal branding.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>You can put on a new suit, but if you lack substance or content, people will see the makeover for what it is&#x2014;shallow and lacking real proof of change.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>Regis McKenna, Silicon Valley brand guru and my former boss, put it best when he told me in a recent email:</a>
</p>
<p class="bq"><a data-bp-start-time='36'>My concern is that &#x201C;personal branding&#x201D; only works if there is valued content.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>Example, when Steve Jobs left &#x005B;Apple&#x005D; he was often compared to Adam Osborne and Nolan Bushnell&#x2014;people who blew it.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>His credibility was zero as far as personal computing was concerned even after he rejoined Apple in 1998.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>People only sat up and took notice when the iMac (the multi-colored editions) took off and Apple returned to growth and profitability.</a>
</p>
<p class="bq"><a data-bp-start-time='48'>Profitability and growth are the two best marketing programs a company or its leader can use to gain leadership.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>You may recall that I used to quote Tevye from <em>Fiddler on the Roof.</em></a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'> &#x201C;If I were a rich man, I would sit in the temple and lecture to the wise man all day long and it wouldn&#x2019;t matter if you know or not, when you&#x2019;re rich, they think you know.&#x201D;</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>I can&#x2019;t agree with him more. When you have the goods, it&#x2019;s a lot easier to brand yourself and to get recognized.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='60'>But having the goods isn&#x2019;t all.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'>You need to position what you have to your best competitive advantage.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'>What if you are just starting out, or if you are weak on evidence that sets you apart?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='69'>Mia is an example of how you can build your evidence from scratch.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='72'>Hers may not be the model for everyone, but it does demonstrate how far you can go with strong aptitude and hard work.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='75'>Mia got her college degree in theater and had thought she wanted to be an actress.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='78'>However, after taking a career aptitude test, she decided she was better suited to a career in web design and development.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='81'>Luckily for her, new web programming standards meant that her learning curve was not that much steeper than that for experienced developers.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='84'>Mia self-studied with the latest web programming books and spent six months writing sample programs with the help of an experienced mentor.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='87'>When she felt ready, she priced her services right and got a contracting job in web development with a small professional services firm.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='90'>As she worked to build her portfolio, she positioned herself on LinkedIn as a front-end web developer with strong consumer understanding (from her retail jobs and acting) and artistic sensibility (evidenced by her theater design and art background).</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='93'>Her LinkedIn profile attracted job recruiters and she landed a full-time job with a mobile web software start-up doing customer-facing web development&#x2014;the cool interactive stuff you see on mobile screens. Even if you have little to work with, you can dramatically reinvent your brand the way Mia did with hard work, smart</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='96'>positioning and a little help from some friends.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='99'>We&#x2019;ve touched on the concept of personal branding, but let&#x2019;s make sure we are on the same page in how we define it.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='102'>Think of personal branding as both what you create (your personal brand) and the act of creating it.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='105'><strong><span class="orange">A personal brand</span></strong> is your image and reputation.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='108'>Whether you like it or not, you already have a personal brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='111'>The world perceives you in a particular way and puts you in certain categories.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='114'>From an external imaging standpoint, what you wear, your personality, and your gestures and presence guide how people perceive you.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='117'>But, more importantly, your unique knowledge and experience (e.g., mobile technology licensing or change management) is the foundation of your brand value.</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='120'><strong>Are you known for something of value, or are you a victim of others branding you?</strong></a></h3>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='123'>For instance, perhaps you need to reinvent your brand from:</a>
</p>
<div class="blist0a">
<p class="blist"><a data-bp-start-time='126'><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Doer to leader</a></p>
<p class="blist"><a data-bp-start-time='129'><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Inexperienced graduate to a professional with 21st-century skills</a></p>
<p class="blist"><a data-bp-start-time='132'><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Technology geek to technology business CEO</a></p>
</div>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='135'>If your current brand will not get you to the next level of your career or the next business opportunity, you need to change your brand.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='138'><strong><span class="orange">Personal branding</span></strong> is the act of developing the strategy and actions to guide your brand.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='141'>What should you be saying and doing to represent your brand the way you want?</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='144'><strong>Without a brand goal, strategy and action plan, personal branding becomes akin to baking a cake without a recipe.</strong></a></h3>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='147'>You may hope for a three-tiered masterpiece but end up with an inedible concoction.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='150'>With a good strategy and action plan, you can create a personal brand that makes the world want to hire, promote or fund you.</a>
