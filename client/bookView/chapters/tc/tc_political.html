<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>After residing in Palo Alto for seven years, Hillary Freeman decided to run for City Council in her California hometown.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>A devoted wife, soccer mom and public schools volunteer, Hillary worked as a high-tech sales executive in Silicon Valley.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>Having moved to Palo Alto from Los Angeles, she loved the character and charm of her adopted city.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>However, Hillary had a challenge.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>Home to Stanford University, Palo Alto was a community of well-educated, high-income and predominantly white citizens.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>Blacks represented less than 2 percent of the population at the time&#x2014;and Hillary Freeman is African American.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>Although politically progressive, Palo Alto, like any place, was not immune to racial prejudice.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'> At a Hillary Freeman campaign event early in the race, for instance, a newspaper photographer took her photo and, thinking she was a volunteer and not the candidate, asked where she lived.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>&#x201C;Palo Alto,&#x201D; she replied.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>&#x201C;You mean <em>East</em> Palo Alto,&#x201D; he said, since many believed the only blacks in town were from East Palo Alto, a neighboring town that had a reputation for drug-related violence.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>In order to meet her goal, Hillary needed to get past racial stereotypes and the fact that she had no political experience.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>Working with her as the campaign strategist, we created a brand that positioned her as the face of new leadership in Palo Alto&#x2014;a high-tech exec whose business skills and empathy could align city policies with community values.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>Hillary, her campaign team and I strategized to match Hillary&#x2019;s unique strengths with the needs of the community.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>We paired the critical issues facing Palo Alto with the need for a City Council member who had a business background to tackle budget issues, along with the values of a mom with school-age children (education, libraries and sports fields) and a homeowner concerned about balancing the needs of development with neighborhood character.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>We built a coalition of stakeholders who were invested in her success because her campaign spoke to their needs and vision for Palo Alto.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>By focusing on shared values and her education (BA and MS degrees), Hillary seemed like &#x201C;one of us&#x201D; and not a black outsider.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>During the campaign, Hillary went from being an unknown minority volunteer to an exciting candidate who best represented Palo Alto ideals.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>The results of Hillary&#x2019;s campaign and brand transformation were stunning.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'>She not only won a seat on the City Council, but also was the highest vote-getter in a field of 13, besting two incumbents and ousting the sitting mayor.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>Hillary had to overcome seemingly insurmountable odds to reach her goal.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='60'>She is living proof that branding does pay.</a>
