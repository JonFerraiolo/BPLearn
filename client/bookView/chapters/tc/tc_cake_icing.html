	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>You can be your own brand expert. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>You just have to &#x201C;bake the cake, then ice it.&#x201D;</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>You may wonder what a cake has to do with branding. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>The cake is just a metaphor to help us understand what branding is all about. Think of the iced cake as your brand.</a>

</div>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'>To be a strong brand, you need to have both cake and icing. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'>You need to marry the rational with the emotional.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='69'>You&#x2019;ve probably met people who appeared to be all icing and no cake.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='72'> For instance, our first impression when seeing a beautiful supermodel might be that she is all icing. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='75'>Then there are people who appear to be all cake and no icing, the stereotype for most engineers. You need to achieve a balance.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='78'>Let&#x2019;s look at a consumer brand example to help us better understand the role of cake and icing. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='81'>Starbucks is a leading caf&#x00E9; and coffee brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='84'> Starbucks&#x2019; cake, or rational value, is providing a consistently good cup of coffee.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='87'> The icing, or emotional value, is providing an inviting gathering place, friendly baristas, support for worthy causes and, for some, a brand that introduces us to new music. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='90'>Starbucks has many competitors, but few have its rational and emotional brand power.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='93'>It&#x2019;s easy to see how consumer products are branded, but how does the branding of people work? </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='96'>Before we take a look at you, let&#x2019;s look at people who are more sophisticated in the care and feeding of their brands&#x2014;that is, celebrities.</a>
</p>
<p class="fig"><img src="../images/36_img01.jpg" alt="image" />
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='99'><span class="gray">When you look at this picture of actor George Clooney, what is the first thing that comes to mind?</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='102'><span class="gray">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a talented actor and director.&#x201D; </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='105'>That&#x2019;s cake.</span></a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='108'><span class="gray">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a handsome and charming guy.&#x201D; </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='111'>That&#x2019;s icing.</span></a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='114'><span class="gray">&#x201C;He&#x2019;s a humanitarian activist.&#x201D; </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='117'>That&#x2019;s both cake (rational value as a humanitarian) and icing (emotional value as someone who cares).</span></a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='120'>We can go through quick associations for other celebrities like Kim Kardashian (cake=reality star and icing=beauty), Hillary Clinton (cake=Secretary of State and icing=personable and caring) and Bono (cake=rock singer and icing=humanitarian who cares).</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='123'>What we associate with people can be both good and bad. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='126'>You might say that you know of people who have reputations as being jerks, but they are still successful. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='129'>I can think of a number of CEOs who demoralize employees by belittling them. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='132'>These company leaders will ride high as long as they deliver bottom-line results.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='135'>But when they no longer produce the expected results, these CEOs, whose negative icing outweighs the positive cake, become vulnerable.</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='138'>Let&#x2019;s leave the celebrity realm and move closer to your reality. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='141'>What are the personal brands that you admire in your profession? </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='144'>What is the cake and what is the icing of those who are successful?</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='147'>See <a href="#fig1.4">Figure 1.4</a> for a chart of some personal brands for professionals. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='150'>Try to articulate what you think your cake and icing are. </a>
