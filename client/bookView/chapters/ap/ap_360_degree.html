<p class="noindent">Alison achieved her goal by implementing her positioning and brand strategy through a Brand Action Plan, the fifth step in the BrandingPays System. The brand action plan will help you to deliver a 360-degree brand&#x2014;a clear and consistent delivery of your brand through all communications, gestures and actions.</p>
<p class="noindent">By following the BrandingPays System, you have completed your 1) positioning, 2) messaging, 3) brand strategy and 4) ecosystem. You now have all the ingredients for your cake and icing. Now you will finalize the recipe.</p>
<p class="noindent">We have divided the Brand Action Plan into two courses of action: brand improvement and brand communication. Brand improvement will help you to improve on those areas necessary for delivering on your brand promise. In other words, if you want to be a spice cake and lack spice, you can take action to remedy this deficiency in brand improvement. Brand communication ensures that you build awareness and recognition for your brand by communicating your cake and icing.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let&#x2019;s take a more detailed look at what goes into brand improvement, and how we define actions for brand communication.</p>
