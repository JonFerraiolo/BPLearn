<h2 id="h2_8"><span class="gray">Lessons from Rebranding an Entrepreneurial Company</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Biosys, a small company in the agricultural biotech industry, was on the verge of bankruptcy due to poor positioning on multiple fronts&#x2014;market positioning, company positioning and technology positioning. Customers did not understand the market that Biosys served or the company&#x2019;s technological value, and neither did potential investors. How could tiny Biosys compete against the giant agrichemical companies that were developing their own biological pesticide lines? The giants were competing in the crowded market for pesticides that targeted leaf-eating insects. Biosys, on the other hand, had a biological product that killed pests in the soil. Regis McKenna, my then boss, and I divided the market into an above-ground segment and a below-ground segment. Biosys could credibly compete in the subterranean market segment that had few competitors. The estimated &#x0024;4 billion segment for underground biological pesticides was large enough for this start-up&#x2019;s initial market.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, Biosys was not well positioned as a technology company&#x2014;a real negative for Silicon Valley investors. The company had a reputation as &#x201C;dirt worm farmers&#x201D; due to confusing positioning and messaging. We helped Biosys to reposition itself as an agricultural biotech company using proprietary genetic technology. The new message: Biosys develops beneficial nematodes (microscopic organisms) with customized genetics to &#x201C;seek and destroy&#x201D; underground pests.</p>
<p><a id="page138" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The company lacked the &#x201C;hot company&#x201D; image that start-ups needed to get funded. We got the buzz going for Biosys by holding an invitation-only event at the company&#x2019;s offices. The main purpose was to reintroduce Biosys to the investment community and other influencers as a technology company with great prospects. Museum-like poster displays told the story of the market need, segmentation and technology. Scientists in white lab coats explained the custom genetics used and demonstrated the proprietary production techniques. At the white-tent catered affair, luminaries and current partners extolled Biosys&#x2019;s virtues, then the well-coached president presented the company story and opportunity to an enthusiastic crowd.</p>
<p class="noindent">The upshot? Within a week of the event, Biosys had two investment bankers vying to take the company public. Six months later, Biosys raised &#x0024;30 million in its initial public offering. Not bad for a bunch of &#x201C;dirt worm farmers.&#x201D;</p>
