Let&#x2019;s revisit sections of our Brand Strategy Platform to see a sampling of brand improvements for some of our individual branding examples.</p>

<p class="noindent"><a id="page126" /><a href="#fig6.5">Figure 6.5</a> is a sample brand improvement template. As you look at the gaps between your current brand and desired brand in the Brand Strategy Platform, you will recognize areas where you need to improve. I have populated this brand improvement template with some areas that are key to strong brands. However, you can customize the Key Areas to Improve column to the specific areas in which you need work.</p>

<p class="noindent">To give you an idea of what a high-level brand improvement plan might look like, see <a href="#fig6.6">Fig. 6.6</a>. The Rating column should be filled with a number, with 1 indicating very low achievement and 5, very high achievement. This number should reflect how you are currently perceived based on your own assessment and feedback from others. Over time, your goal should be to raise all of your scores to a 4 or 5.</p>
<p><a id="page127" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Put what may be holding you back in the Challenge column. In Priority Actions, list a few key actions you can take to change your behavior and people&#x2019;s perceptions of you. In Allies and Tools, identify the BrandingPays tool and other people and resources who could help you to make the improvements you seek.</p>
