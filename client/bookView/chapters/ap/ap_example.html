<p class="noindent">Mike is now positioned as a visionary leader in open software for the graphical web both inside his company and in the industry. He deliberately chose to reinvent his brand. Mike&#x2019;s cake relies heavily on his technical understanding and vision, and his icing is anchored by an engaging personality. A self-admitted nerd, he is well groomed but doesn&#x2019;t spend a lot of time thinking about his wardrobe. As a matter of fact, if he were too fashionable, the other technologists might look at him askance.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a id="page137" />The BrandingPays System has its roots in the product and company positioning work that I have done for the past two decades. Company examples, such as Biosys below, are useful illustrations of differentiation and messaging strategies that individuals can undertake to reinvent their own brands.</p>
