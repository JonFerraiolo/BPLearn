<p class="noindent">Your personal brand as a founder is highly dependent on the brand positioning for your company and vice versa. If your company has a poor image, it will reflect badly on you. Your company positioning and messaging must be clear. Likewise, if your personal brand as a leader lacks the vision, passion and drive to be successful, few will want to follow.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are seeking funding, tell your company story in a compelling way and engage investors in your vision. Let both your company brand and personal brand shine. At the reintroduction event, Biosys was true to its brand strategy, from the messaging and the visual branding to the caliber of event guests and ambiance. The clear strategy empowered every employee and partner to represent Biosys well. You have the same opportunity to shape your company&#x2019;s brand and to be seen as the chief evangelist and visionary. Don&#x2019;t hide behind other executives. <a id="page139" />Investors want the founder to sell them on the vision. Remember, if you want to come across as a strong entrepreneur, bring your company story alive with a clear strategy and compelling marketing opportunity. Entrepreneurs with a good idea but who lack passion and drive will find it hard to get funded. You need both cake and icing.</p>
