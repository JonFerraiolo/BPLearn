<p class="noindent">A couple of years ago, Alison, a corporate lawyer in a large company, got a new boss. A self-described good presenter, Alison, unfortunately, was not at her best during her first presentation in front of him. He made a snap judgment that this was a weakness of hers. In addition, he seemed to think that she was just a generalist when it came to corporate law.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alison realized she had a branding problem. If she wanted to get the recognition and the opportunities that she desired, she had to reinvent her brand in the eyes of her boss and those around him. She applied the BrandingPays System and worked to change perceptions of her brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">First, she determined her positioning differentiation. She realized she could combine her legal specialty, business background and experience in the firm&#x2019;s technology to set her apart. Alison positioned herself as an intellectual property (IP) specialist who could strategically manage the technology patent portfolio from both a legal and business standpoint. In short, her positioning goal became the Strategic IP Lawyer.</p>
<p class="noindent">When she compared her current brand to her desired brand in the Brand Strategy Platform, she recognized that she needed to work on collaboration skills and upgrade to a more professional look that commanded greater authority.</p>
<p class="noindent">Alison&#x2019;s priority action was to change the negative opinion her boss held about her presentation skills and her differentiated value. She volunteered to do multiple presentations on strategic IP management to both technology and business groups in the company as well as professional organizations. She made sure that her boss saw her in action. She developed compelling presentations tailored to her audiences that demonstrated her strategic business and IP expertise. By sharing her knowledge with different groups, she underscored her collaborative attitude. She got people to take another look at her both because of a sleeker professional wardrobe and because she backed it up with content and a strong delivery.</p>
<p><a id="page123" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Within three months of implementing her new brand, Alison&#x2019;s boss praised her in his staff meeting for her great presentations, her collaboration within the company and her strategic contributions in managing the company&#x2019;s patent portfolio. Within a year, Alison got her promotion. Branding does pay!</p>
