<h2 id="h2_5"><span class="gray">Brand Communication</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Once you have a credible foundation for delivering on your brand, you can embark on your brand communication plan. Does this mean that you need to address all areas of brand improvement before communicating your new brand? No, but you do need a minimal set of evidence to be credible. If your desired brand is to be a collaborative leader and you are acting like a lone cowboy, you need to work on your collaboration skills and opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">The elements of your brand communication program will be different from another person&#x2019;s because you have a unique set of circumstances driving your actions. These include your goal, target audience, positioning, desired brand, strengths, current perceptions, ecosystem and environment. Don&#x2019;t think of communications as a checklist of standard items. Let your strategy drive your tactics. If you have a short-term goal influenced by only a handful of people in your company, you should focus on direct communication with these influencers rather than doing a broad communications program. However, if your goal is to boost your visibility in the industry to increase your career opportunities, you will need to broaden your reach.</p>
<h2 id="h2_6"><span class="gray">Four Phases of Brand Communication Using the Ecosystem Model (Advanced)</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The Four Phases of Brand Communication model (<a href="#fig6.7">Figure 6.7</a>) will help you to develop a brand communication plan that engages different parts of the ecosystem depending on the phase. This brand communication model has been proven successful with both product and company launches throughout my career in Silicon Valley. It works equally well when you are reinventing (or launching) your personal brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">The Regis McKenna Inc. team that handled Apple product launches introduced me to a version of the Four Phases model. If you wonder how companies successfully get key influencers to say good things about their products when they launch, pay attention to this model. Think of yourself as a product to be launched. You need to 1) validate your &#x201C;product&#x201D; concept, 2) build a reference or partner structure, 3) have influencers give their <a id="page129" />endorsements publicly when you launch and 4) communicate evidence of your momentum and success.</p>
<h3><strong>A phased model for communicating your personal brand is very helpful in understanding whom to talk to, when, what to say, and how to establish and maintain your brand leadership.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The first two phases are done in private to ensure that your value messages are compelling to your target audience, and to build the reference structure that you&#x2019;ll need to be credible with your brand communications.</p>
<p class="noindent">The second two phases are the public phases, and apply to when your brand is made public, when references publicly support you and when you continue to build your leadership position with additional announcements and evidence.</p>
<p class="noindent">Different parts of the ecosystem are more important at different phases of communication. Note that early on, you need to concentrate on those influencers who are closer to you in terms of their stakeholder relationship. In Phase 4, others may try to copy your leadership claims, so you will need to continue to raise the bar of leadership through new ideas, thought leadership, achievements and other evidence that show your momentum. If you are repositioning, introducing a new initiative or launching something new, you will need to repeat these four phases.</p>
