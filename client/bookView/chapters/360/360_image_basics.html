<h2 id="h2_4"><span class="gray">Your Look, Your Image: The Basics</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Those who already have the fundamentals of how to present themselves through their external image may skip this section. However, even if you think you have your act together in terms of your external style, it makes sense to peruse this section and consider carefully whether everything you are doing today best represents your brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">Remember that strong branding is a marriage of cake (rational value) and icing (emotional value). Business generally places the highest value on cake. But, as economist D. S. Hamermesh documents in his book <em>Beauty Pays: Why Attractive People Are More Successful</em><sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_4" id="B_4">4</a></sup>, attractive people get paid more and get more opportunities.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is more evidence that presenting an attractive image in the context of your business environment is important. In <em>Impressive First Impressions,</em> authors Vu H. Pham and Lisa Miyake cite studies where participants took only milliseconds to form impressions of faces (39 milliseconds)<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_5" id="B_5">5</a></sup> or websites (90 milliseconds)<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_6" id="B_6">6</a></sup>. People often make snap judgments based on initial images or impressions.</p>
<p class="noindent">We cannot all be tall, thin and beautiful. However, we can present an attractive image no matter what our size, shape or physical attributes. Think of your body and your face as a canvas. What are the colors, textures and symbols that can represent your values and personality? How can you present an attractive image?</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Posture and carriage.</span></strong> Let&#x2019;s start with your posture and how you carry yourself. If you stand tall, you will come across as more confident. A slumping posture, besides potentially leading to health problems, gives the appearance of indifference, lack of confidence or even depression. People who sit erect at a conference table or who lean forward slightly look awake and engaged. Walk tall and carry yourself with pride if you want respect from others.</p>
<p><a id="page149" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Attitude and well-being.</span></strong> A positive attitude is attractive. A negative one is not. There may be legitimate times to let people know if you are feeling down, but, for the most part, keep your feelings about being tired or being put upon at work or home to yourself. Your boss, clients or colleagues want to hear about solutions, not problems.</p>
<p class="noindent">Try to live a healthy life by eating right, exercising and managing stress (yoga, meditation and being in nature can help). No one will want to give you a challenging job or to fund your company if you seem to be sinking mentally, physically or emotionally. If you look in the mirror and see bright eyes in a smiling face, you are radiating well-being.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Be kind and respect others.</span></strong> Treating others how you would like to be treated is common courtesy. Listen to what others have to say, show empathy and help them out if you can. Small acts of kindness done with authenticity can bond people to you for life, creating brand loyalty.</p>
<p class="noindent">Respect for others includes respecting their time. Be punctual. Be concise in your communications, including emails and phone messages. Organize your thoughts in advance. Use bullets in emails and call attention to deadlines or action items. Your recipients will appreciate your getting to the point, whether it is in written or spoken communications.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Hair.</span></strong> A well-done hairstyle can enhance your image. (See <a href="chapter008.xhtml">chapter 8</a> for more on hair for profile photos.) A neat, contemporary cut will underscore your professionalism and modern sensibilities. Most hair salons will give you a free consultation, so take advantage of this offer to get a professional opinion on the optimal cut for your hair.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Face.</span></strong> For women, well-applied facial makeup can help to create a more pleasing image. (See makeup tips for photos in <a href="chapter008.xhtml">chapter 8</a>.) If you have features and skin tone that make you seem washed out, you may blend into your work environment. You need to be visible to make your brand known. Judicious application of some foundation, blush, mascara and lipstick can help you to stand out in a positive way. Avoid an overly made-up look, as it will look unnatural. Ask a makeup professional to help if you are unsure of what to do.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Grooming, scents and perfume.</span></strong> Good grooming is essential for making a positive impression. Even if you are a software genius, maintaining good grooming habits will enhance your opportunities.</p>
<p><a id="page150" /></p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Many people have allergic reactions to perfumes and colognes, so if you do use a scent, make sure it is lightly applied.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Showering daily and wearing deodorant should keep away any negative scents (!).</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Brush and floss your teeth, and use mouthwash to ensure that your smile and your breath are pleasing. It&#x2019;s hard to appear businesslike with spinach between your teeth, so floss after meals, if necessary. After eating spicy meals, it may be wise to brush your teeth and to use breath mints. When I was in Korea, where a pungent pickle called <em>kimchi</em> is eaten regularly, I noticed that nearly every woman in the office building brushed her teeth after lunch.</p>

<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Wardrobe.</span></strong> American humorist and writer Mark Twain was making a joke when he said, &#x201C;The clothes make the man,&#x201D; but, there is truth to this. When a man or woman walks confidently into a room in a fine, well-tailored suit with shoes and accessories to match, the natural reaction is: &#x201C;Wow!&#x201D; Yet some company cultures are decidedly casual and such dress would be out of place. It&#x2019;s important to understand the context and culture of where you are doing business to decide what is appropriate dress and what is not.</p>
<p class="noindent">Another popular saying, &#x201C;When in Rome, do as the Romans do,&#x201D; comes to mind when I think about what people wear. A mid-level U.S. executive who traveled to Switzerland on business shocked her European colleagues by wearing jeans to her last day of meetings there. Her rationale was that she had to leave for the airport immediately after the meetings ended and wanted to be comfortable on the plane ride home. You can be sure that how she dressed distracted from the points she wanted to make, and probably contributed to her reputation as a rude American not well suited for a global executive role. Showing sensitivity and adaptability to different cultures is important in any company&#x2014;especially a global one.</p>
<p class="noindent">If your company is into casual dress (such as jeans and T-shirts) and you want to fit in but still maintain a more professional look, consider wearing dark blue jeans and cropped jackets. Going casual does not have to mean unkempt T-shirts, dirty gym shoes and frayed jeans. I like the term &#x201C;geek chic,&#x201D; meaning a casual style with a fashion edge.</p>
<p><a id="page151" /></p>
<p class="noindent">I truly believe that beauty starts inside of you and radiates out. If you are at peace with your values and have a passion for life and your ideas, people will be attracted to you. You will radiate a positive vibe and confidence. What you wear can enhance your attractiveness, but it&#x2019;s what&#x2019;s in your soul that is most important.</p>
