<h2 id="h2_5"><span class="gray">Branding in Multimedia</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Posting podcasts, videos and presentations online is a popular way to get your brand recognized by a wide audience. However, make sure that these formats enhance your image. Today, many people are putting up do-it-yourself content on the web. Using a smartphone or a laptop with a video cam, people can instantly add video to their social media posts. Although viewers are forgiving when it comes to on-the-go photos or video postings, a video r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; or video brochure should have better production value. Unfortunately, I have seen some video r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9;s that hurt rather than helped the chances of the job candidates.</p>
<p class="noindent">Bad lighting that casts you in shadows can make you look more like a criminal than a professional manager. A rambling elevator pitch punctuated by too many ums and ahs, fidgeting hands and nervous blinking can cast doubt on your presence and communications capability. You don&#x2019;t have to memorize a speech, but do write down and remember your key talking points (See <a href="chapter003.xhtml">chapter 3</a>).</p>
<p class="noindent">If you have a naturally high-pitched voice, try lowering it. If you speak in a monotone, try modulating your voice to sound more interesting. Smile while you talk and your voice will naturally sound more lively.</p>
<p class="noindent">To come across confidently, you need to look directly at the lens of the video camera. You can color in a black circle, tape it to your wall and practice looking at it while you go through your key talking points. Then, start practicing in front of a video camera. Do 20 takes of your elevator pitch until you get it to sound natural.</p>
<p class="noindent">The most important thing in video is connecting with your audience. Imagine talking to real people, friends who are interested in what you say. As a song made popular by Louis Armstrong goes: &#x201C;When you&#x2019;re smiling &#x2026; the whole world smiles with you.&#x201D; It couldn&#x2019;t be more true!</p>

<p class="noindentq"><strong><span class="orange">Presentations</span></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">When you present&#x2014;whether in your company or at an outside event&#x2014;your brand is on center stage, so make the most of it.</p>
<p class="noindent">All of the earlier suggestions about how to look, smile and use your voice to effect in photos, videos and audio apply to presentations. Think of 360-degree branding.</p>
<p class="noindent">I have coached a number of the mid-level executives who wanted to be seen as more strategic. Presentations are an excellent way to demonstrate strategic thinking. Say that you have to do a progress report to executives on an initiative you are leading. Doing a one-slide intro that graphically depicts the corporate objective that your initiative helps to achieve, or a slide that shows the driving trends, will show that you see the big picture. Instead of diving into the details of implementation, lay out the initiative graphically with a colorful chart showing key milestones.</p>
<p class="noindent">Your presentation should follow the &#x201C;inverted pyramid&#x201D; approach of general or high-level ideas followed by key points and evidence details. Thoughtful organization will make your presentation easier to understand and show that you have a strategic and analytical mind.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you need tips on how to put together and execute a great presentation, there are a number of good books to consult. Check out the Further Reading section at the end of this book.</p>
<p class="noindentq"><strong><span class="orange">Business Cards and Documents</span></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">What does your business card say about you? If your company has issued you a business card, you don&#x2019;t have much say in how you come across except for your title and contact information. But, if you are an entrepreneur or consultant, your business card should be designed to communicate your brand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Company name:</span></strong> Is your company name memorable, easy to say and spell, and does it enhance your brand awareness and brand promise? Not all company names will satisfy all criteria for a good name, but if you have an opportunity to choose a company name, try to select one that will help your brand.</p>
<p><a id="page153" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Logo:</span></strong> Is your logo creative and attractive? Is it aligned with your brand?</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Font:</span></strong> Is the font easy to read in all formats&#x2014;print, web, black-and-white and color? Does it have a more contemporary look, like those found in sans serif typefaces such as Helvetica, or is it a serif font such as Times Roman? Many designers can create a custom logotype, which is a unique font, for your logo. For those in marketing or creative areas, custom logotypes reinforce your expertise and creative values.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Colors:</span></strong> What does your color palette say about you? Soft pastels are associated with feminine qualities. Red and black seem more masculine. Grays and dark blues look more corporate. There is no steadfast rule when it comes to colors, but it would make sense to choose a different palette from your competitors so that you stand out. A good designer can show you a number of color palettes&#x2014;main colors with accent colors.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Paper stock:</span></strong> When you hand out your business card, people will feel the weight of the stock. If your card is made of flimsy paper, it will give the appearance of a business that can&#x2019;t afford better card stock or that doesn&#x2019;t care about quality. Your designer or printer can guide you on the best choice of paper for your business card or other printed pieces.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Printing:</span></strong> You do not have to pay for an expensive offset printing process to have a quality business card. Professional printing services offer digital printers that achieve excellent printing results at a reasonable cost. Your business card is important in setting a first impression and could be referenced afterward. Make sure that the printing quality represents your brand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Documents:</span></strong> Whether your documents live in digital form or are printed, ensure that they reflect well on your brand. Check for attractiveness and consistency of design and fonts, and correct spelling and grammar. Edit your documents so that the writing is concise and that the flow is logical. A document with good content will be enhanced by strong design and editing.</p>
