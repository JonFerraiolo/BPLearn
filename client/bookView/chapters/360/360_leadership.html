<h2 id="h2_3"><span class="gray">Vision or Thought Leadership Branding</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">As Randy Paynter and the Care2 story show, a strong vision can be the driving force behind your brand and brand actions. Often the vision provides the value, emotional connection and best association for your brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">For entrepreneurs, your vision for the industry and your company is worth as much to investors as the actual product idea and current implementation.</p>
<p class="noindent">For company managers, your vision for culture, leadership and the industry may largely determine how high you rise in the organization.</p>
<p class="noindent">For recent MBAs, your fresh vision and ideas may be the new blood that companies seek when they look to hire.</p>
<p class="noindent">Let&#x2019;s see how Libby, a recent MBA graduate, has reinvented her brand and crafted a new vision to help differentiate her value. Libby didn&#x2019;t wait until graduation to rebrand herself as an entrepreneur. As a matter of fact, she has reinvented her brand a few times in her young career. She has repositioned her brand from being known as a print editor to a digital editor to a social media consultant to a digital community entrepreneur. She made it happen by learning new areas, volunteering, blogging on her expertise and engaging with influencers in new ecosystems. She has been active on key social media platforms like Twitter and Facebook, and has blended her online persona with in-person engagement at digital, innovation and entrepreneurial conferences.</p>
<p><a id="page147" /></p>
<p class="noindent">When it came time to attract investor funding for her company, she was so intent on explaining the technology and product features (cake) that she lost sight of the emotional connection to investors (icing). Libby is not unlike so many entrepreneurs who are enthralled with their product or technology but lose sight of the emotional side of their brand. Where is the passion for making a difference in the world? What is the big idea?</p>
<p class="noindent">We worked together to emphasize a vision that would resonate on both an intellectual and an emotional level with customers and investors. Her company was not just offering up a digital community with curated events and jobs, but was enabling a new trend toward blending the worlds of work and life for creative digital and technology people. Her goal: Mesh cool local events and people from different disciplines to inspire new ideas, companies and partnerships. She has embarked on a program to evangelize her vision of creative collaboration through work-life blending with blogging, speaking at conferences and engaging the influencers. Libby is the face of this vision and her company enables it&#x2014;city by city. She has aligned her personal brand with her company brand. In the process, she has created an emotional, aspirational connection, as all entrepreneurs should for strong branding.</p>
<p class="noindent">Realtors in the residential real estate market face difficulty differentiating in an area that has become oversaturated with sales agents all claiming similar experience. Thought leadership expressed in a methodology that you own can set you apart. Michael, the owner of a boutique realty company in an affluent area of California, has developed a unique methodology for the premium pricing of residential real estate. Developing a methodology, productizing it and branding it can go a long way toward making an intangible (service) into something tangible (product). We&#x2019;ve helped numerous professional services companies, executives and consultants to develop and brand processes to help differentiate themselves from competitors.</p>
<p class="noindent">Michael&#x2019;s branded methodology coupled with his expertise and experience in the sales of luxury homes on the private market has made him unique in the industry. He blogs on related topics, and has been quoted as an expert in leading business publications and local media. His thought leadership brand reflects well on his company, attracting the best realtors and well-qualified clients. In turn, his company&#x2019;s continued growth and success helps provide positive evidence for his personal brand.</p>
