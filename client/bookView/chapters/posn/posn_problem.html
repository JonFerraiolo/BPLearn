<h3><strong>
	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>In positioning, we are either solving a problem or enabling an opportunity.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>Sometimes it&#x2019;s both.</a>
</strong></h3>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>In defining the problem statement, ask: What is the main problem my target audience faces?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>What are their challenges that I can address?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>Only when you understand these well can you start to position yourself as part of the solution.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>Otherwise you might be a perfect solution, but to the wrong problem&#x2014;a problem your target audience doesn&#x2019;t happen to have.</a>

<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>Do you recall Eileen, our product marketing director who wanted to be promoted as a vice president?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>She chose her boss, the Senior VP of Marketing, as her target audience.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>However, her target audience should have been the executive leadership team who would have to promote her as a peer, and whose needs were different from the pain points of the VP of Marketing.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>By choosing the wrong target audience, her positioning strategy for becoming a vice president would be less effective.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>As Eileen&#x2019;s example points out, the target audience, problem statement and value proposition are intricately linked.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>If you are looking for a job and don&#x2019;t have an insider&#x2019;s view of what your target audience needs, do your homework.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>Ask friends in that field.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>Do a Google search on the company.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>Look them up in Yahoo Finance.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>Business analyst reports are a great way to see where companies&#x2019; weak spots are.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>Go to LinkedIn and look at the backgrounds of the targets with whom you might be interviewing.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>Where might they be feeling insecure?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'>For instance, say you are interviewing with a VP of Marketing who has spent most of his career on the technical and sales side and may feel inadequate as a marketer.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>You can position yourself as a strong career marketer who empowers teams with marketing skills transfer.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='60'>Never underestimate the importance of this step.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'How can you begin to position yourself as the answer to someone&#x2019;s problem if you aren&#x2019;t clear on who that person is and what the person&#x2019;s problems are?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'Ask yourself: what kind of cake is your audience hungry for?</a>
