<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>Bob and Mike are software programmers in their fifties.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>Years ago, they were both at the top of their field in graphics software for the desktop.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>Bob was confident his programming skills that got him to where he was today would carry him through to retirement.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>He was wrong.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>The technology landscape changed with mobile and browser-based computing.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>He was laid off from his job and could not find a new one because he was branded as &#x201C;old school.&#x201D;</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>Mike, however, constantly kept a sharp eye on maintaining his unique value to his field&#x2014;that is, his cake.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>At different intervals in his career, he asked, &#x201C;What are the big-picture trends in the industry, in technology and in my company?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>What can I do to take advantage of changes in my environment?&#x201D;</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>Mike learned about new technologies, developed relationships with leading technologists and gained a reputation as a visionary.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>When it came time to look for a new job, he got two excellent offers from leading technology companies.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>Today, Mike is recognized at his company and in the industry as a leader in graphical web software.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>Unlike Bob, who is unemployed, Mike positioned himself for new opportunities.</a>
</p>
<h2 id="h2_3"><a data-bp-start-time='45'><span class="gray">What Is Positioning and Why Do It?</span></a></h2>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>When people think of personal branding, they might think wardrobe, mannerisms and catch phrases that others can remember.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>These, however, are just the finishing touches&#x2014;or icing on the cake.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'>Effective personal branding goes much deeper.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>It starts with positioning&#x2014;your cake foundation, or rational value.</a>
</p>
<h2 id="h2_5"><a data-bp-start-time='60'><span class="gray">Positioning Triangulation</span></a></h2>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'>One way to figure out your positioning goal is to explore the options through triangulation (<a href="#fig2.1">Figure 2.1</a>).</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'>That&#x2019;s just a fancy term for a three-pronged model to understand whether there is an audience (an employer, a boss, a venture capitalist or a client) that values what you have to offer.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='69'>This is basically what we do in positioning, but the triangulation model helps with understanding the dependencies.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='72'>By iterating different scenarios in the triangulation model, you will find the best option for you before writing your positioning statement.</a>

<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='90'>Remember Hillary Freeman, who wanted a seat on the Palo Alto City Council?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='93'>The target audience need we identified was that many Palo Alto voters wanted new leadership and passion for their values.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='96'>Hillary&#x2019;s strengths and values were that she was a high-tech business executive who had demonstrated community values as a community and schools volunteer leader.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='99'>We established that there was a need for a candidate with Hillary&#x2019;s strengths and values, but then we had to see if other candidates (her competition) could fulfill the audience need.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='102'>Her opportunity was that few, if any, candidates demonstrated her passion and grass-roots support across key constituencies: schools, library lovers, youth sports, YMCA and neighborhood groups.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='105'>If we found that other candidates had the same messages and evidence that Hillary had, we would have had to change Hillary&#x2019;s positioning goal.</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='114'>Pamela is another interesting example.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='117'>She had spent the last few years as a marketing director for a drug company and had excellent credentials building her product brands and growing the business.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='120'>However, she wanted to move away from marketing and get into the area of her passion: ensuring patient access to health care&#x2014;specifically, her company&#x2019;s therapeutic drugs.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='123'>The good news was that there was less competition in this area versus marketing, and her graduate degree from a school of public health helped to distinguish her.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='126'>The target audience need was real in that her company had significant resources dedicated to patient access and cared about this area.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='129'>In the end, she positioned herself as an accomplished health care executive and patient access expert.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='132'>With clarity on her goal and value, she had the confidence to have a frank talk with her boss about her career path.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='135'>The result?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='138'>Her company created a new job for her that was tailored to her passions and talents.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='141'>Within six months on the job, she was promoted to senior director.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='144'>Pamela is an excellent example of how to best differentiate yourself for an opportunity by optimizing the triangulation of target audience need, your strengths and value, and competition.</a>

<h2 id="h2_6"><a data-bp-start-time='147'><span class="gray">Positioning Statement</span></a></h2>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='150'>The triangulation exercise has prepared you for writing your positioning statement, the first step in the BrandingPays System.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='153'>This statement is a tool to help you to ensure that you have a unique and compelling value proposition for a particular target audience.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='156'>Remember that we &#x201C;bake the cake, then ice it.&#x201D;</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='159'>The cake is your positioning.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='162'>This is the foundation for a strong brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='165'>Without it, your brand would be all fluff, or icing&#x2014;not very substantial or credible.</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='168'><strong>The positioning statement provides the foundation for developing your elevator pitch and key value messages for different audiences.</strong></a></h3>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='171'>It will also provide input to the Brand Strategy Platform (<a href="chapter004.xhtml">chapter 4</a>), where we put your cake and icing together.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='174'>Despite popular belief, your positioning statement is not your elevator pitch.</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='180'>See <a href="#fig2.3">Figure 2.3</a> for our positioning statement template.</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='207'>Geoffrey Moore, the author of <em>Crossing the Chasm</em> and a fellow Regis McKenna partner, did the business world a great service when he developed the positioning statement format that is basically a run-on sentence that goes:</a>
</p>
<p><a data-bp-start-time='210'><span class="orange">For (target audience)<br/>Who needs or wants (problem statement)<br/>Our product is a (category)<br/>That (value proposition)<br/>Unlike (key competitor), our product is &#x2026; (competitive differentiation)</span></a></p>
<p><a data-bp-start-time='213'>The beauty of this format is that it is a great way to ensure you understand your audience&#x2019;s needs and message your value in a compelling way.</a></p>
<p><a data-bp-start-time='216'>When applied to personal branding, you are the &#x201C;product&#x201D; in the positioning statement.</a></p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='219'><strong>Thinking of yourself as a product may help you to see yourself and your opportunities objectively.</strong></a></h3>
