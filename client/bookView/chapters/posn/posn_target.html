	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>Who are they?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>If your goal is to land a great job with a hot new company, that company, your future boss and the HR team are your target audiences.</a>

	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>You need to put a stake in the ground to be known for something.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>It&#x2019;s understandable if you position differently for different job opportunities, but once in a job, keep your positioning the same until you decide to change for strategic reasons.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>If you flit from one positioning category to another, your positioning will be unclear.</a>
