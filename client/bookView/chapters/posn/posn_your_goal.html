<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>Before defining your positioning, let&#x2019;s identify your career or opportunity goal.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>Having such a goal is very important in personal branding.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>If you have a career goal, it will help to guide you in making choices about your desired brand.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>If you are currently a director and want to become a vice president, perhaps you will have to position yourself from a group leader to an effective company leader.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>Think back to Eileen, the marketing director who wanted to be promoted to vice president.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>She needed to demonstrate not only her strategic leadership capability, but also her ability to align her personal brand values with the company&#x2019;s new culture.</a> 
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>Unless they are self-funded, entrepreneurs need to find investors who believe in their companies to reach their dreams.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>Their goal is not getting a job; it is getting the company funded.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>Entrepreneurs have to understand what investors value and position their companies in a way that meets investor needs.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>Often MBA students are getting their degree with the hope of switching careers, say from hardware engineering to marketing.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>If you are an engineer, your first goal out of the MBA program should not be a consumer marketing position.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>It&#x2019;s just too great a leap of faith to go from being a hardware engineer to, say, marketing breakfast cereals.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>It would make more sense to set your sights on a marketing job at a technology company where you could leverage your engineering background.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>When choosing your goals, you need to be somewhat realistic.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>Doing a 180-degree turn in personality or skill set is difficult to achieve.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>Let&#x2019;s say your goal is to become a company CEO but you are shy and feel uncomfortable speaking in public.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>Either your goal needs to change or your personality needs an overhaul, because shyness and feeling ill at ease speaking publicly is not a winning combination for being a CEO.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>You might consider altering your career goal to something that is more within reach.</a>
