<p class="noindent">Hillary Freeman, the city council candidate, was the poster child for branding from the inside out. Her inner passion, creative ideas and desire to engage were reflected in how she communicated her brand externally. She <em>was</em> the new face of Palo Alto leadership, from her ideas and her website to how she dressed and connected with others.</p>
<p class="noindent">Whether you are a professional looking for a job or career change or an entrepreneur looking for funding, you need a brand strategy that puts your cake and icing together for maximum results. A good brand strategy will help guide you in everything you need to do to speed achievement of your goal. When you brand consistently, you help the world know what to think and say about you.</p>
<p class="noindent">Hillary brought her cake and icing together in a Brand Strategy Platform, a tool that helped to ensure that all brand communications from the candidate&#x2019;s behavior to the campaign&#x2019;s marketing programs were in sync with the strategy. We&#x2019;ll explain the Brand Strategy Platform later in this chapter, but first let&#x2019;s look at a simpler view.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig4.1">Figure 4.1</a> shows a simplified view of Hillary&#x2019;s cake (rational value) and icing (emotional value). The cake goal is written at the top. In the table below are two examples of icing: one that does not support her cake and one that does. By the way, Hillary&#x2019;s real icing did, in fact, support her cake. We&#x2019;ve included the contrasting column to illustrate what kind of icing would not have supported Hillary&#x2019;s brand.</p>
