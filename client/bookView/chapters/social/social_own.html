<h2 id="h2_4"><span class="gray">Own Your Online Real Estate</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Your name is a huge part of your brand. If people don&#x2019;t remember your name, you aren&#x2019;t doing a good job of branding.</p>
<p class="noindent">You need to own your online real estate&#x2014;that is, your name online or your vanity URL. If you haven&#x2019;t already done so, sign up on LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter, using your full name (or some combination if your name is already in use) in your URL. Here is how my brand name shows up in key URLs:</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><span class="orange">LinkedIn URL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent0"><a href="http://LinkedIn.com/in/karenkang">LinkedIn.com/in/karenkang</a></p>
<p class="noindent">If you don&#x2019;t have a personal website or blog, you can reference your LinkedIn URL. Make sure the URL contains your name (or some variation on it if it is already taken).</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><span class="orange">Facebook URL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent0"><a href="http://www.Faceboook.com/karenkang.brand">Faceboook.com/karenkang.brand</a></p>
<p class="noindent0"><a href="http://www.Facebook.com/BrandingPays">Facebook.com/BrandingPays</a></p>
<p class="noindent">I originally opened my Facebook account as Karen Kang Consulting, which was before I rebranded as BrandingPays. When I decided to be Karen Kang on Facebook, that URL was taken, so I opted for karenkang.brand. That way, people will find my name with the &#x201C;brand&#x201D; designation that will clue them that this Karen Kang is actually me. For my company and book activities, I use my Facebook page account: facebook.com/BrandingPays.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Note:</span></strong> Facebook will let you change your URL once in your lifetime, so think twice before you make the change. If you are in doubt, test the potential URL change with friends or someone you trust before changing it.</p>
<p><a id="page166" /></p>
<h3 class="h3a"><span class="orange">Twitter handle</span></h3>
<p class="noindent0"><a href="mailto:@karenkang">@karenkang</a></p>
<p class="noindent">I like to have a human face on my Twitter account. I tweet out branding information and engage with my followers. I have toyed with the idea of using a BrandingPays Twitter account, but have opted to discuss my book and speaking events under my <a href="mailto:@karenkang">@karenkang</a> account. The main reasons are for streamlining administration and avoiding duplication.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><span class="orange">Google+ URL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent0">gplus.to/karenkang</p>
<p class="noindent">I am sure that Google will eventually allow Google+ users to have vanity URLs, but currently your Google+ ID is a long string of numbers&#x2014;not very user friendly for business cards or email signatures. To get a shortened vanity URL using your name, you can go to a third-party service like <a href="http://gplus.to/">http://gplus.to/</a> and sign up for your &#x201C;Nickname,&#x201D; as they call it.</p>
<h3 class="h3a"><span class="orange">Website URL</span></h3>
<p class="noindent0"><a href="http://www.Brandingpays.com">Brandingpays.com</a> (previously, <a href="http://kang.com">kang.com</a>)</p>
<p class="noindent">If you have a company, get a URL that includes your company name followed by .com, or.org if you are a nonprofit organization. Emails should be from Your Name <a href="mailto:@YourCompany.com">@YourCompany.com</a>. I got the <a href="http://kang.com">kang.com</a> domain (out of a million people with the Kang surname!) in 1994, and with it, the perfect email address: <a href="mailto:karen@kang.com">karen@kang.com</a>. Now that I have my <a href="http://brandingpays.com">brandingpays.com</a> URL, I go by <a href="mailto:karenkang@brandingpays.com">karenkang@brandingpays.com</a>. I choose to use my full name because that is an important part of my personal brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">For personal branding, try to register your full name as your domain, as in <a href="http://FirstNameLastName.com">FirstNameLastName.com</a>. If it is not available, you can try variations like your first initial and last name, or <a href="http://FirstNameMiddleNameLastName.com">FirstNameMiddleNameLastName.com</a>. This will help you to rank higher in search results for your name.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here is how I use some of my BrandingPays URLs:</p>
<p><a id="page167" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="http://BrandingPays.com"><span class="orange">BrandingPays.com</span></a> My main company site for consulting, training and coaching.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="http://BrandingPays.com/blog"><span class="orange">BrandingPays.com/blog</span></a> My BrandingPays blog.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="http://BrandingPays.com/book"><span class="orange">BrandingPays.com/book</span></a> The site for my BrandingPays book, events and shopping cart.</p>
<p class="noindent">As you can see, I am reinforcing the BrandingPays brand in each of these URLs for different offerings of content and activities.</p>
