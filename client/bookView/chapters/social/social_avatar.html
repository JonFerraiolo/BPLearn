<h2 id="h2_6"><span class="gray">Your Avatar</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">In social media, your avatar (a photo or illustration that is your personal visual identity) is synonymous with your brand. I encourage people to use the same avatar on all their social media platforms. If you use several different avatars, you are diluting the branding effect. For professionals (unless you are an artist), a photo is preferable to an illustration. Pick one photo that represents you well and use it consistently.</p>
<p><a id="page168" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Your brand is highly portable in social media. To ensure your avatar shows up when you comment on blogs, you can register it at a third-party service, such as Gravatar (stands for globally recognized avatar) at <a href="http://en.gravatar.com">https://en.gravatar.com</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">When I browse my Twitter streams, I look for familiar faces. I have friends who are constantly changing their Twitter photos. It makes me work doubly hard to find them, since searching a name is much slower than visual recognition.</p>
<p class="noindent">People will have a hard time remembering your brand if you are changing it frequently. Imagine that your favorite consumer brands changed their logo, colors and design every month&#x2014;how would your recognize them in the store? As in consumer branding, personal brands become recognized faster with consistency and frequency. Therefore, choose one good profile photo for use on all your social networks.</p>
<p class="noindent">Here is a checklist to evaluate your choice of avatar photo:</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Clarity.</span></strong> Is the photo clear and in focus? A grainy photo from your last vacation will not present you in a professional light. Consider paying a professional to take your photo.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Lighting.</span></strong> Does the lighting enhance your look? Bad lighting that highlights dark circles under the eyes, that washes out your complexion or that makes you look sinister will detract from the positive aspects of your brand. A professional will light interior shots to avoid shadows, or choose the most flattering time of day for an outdoor shot.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Smile.</span></strong> Do you have a genuine smile? A closed-mouth smile is not as inviting as a broad smile. In a wonderful book called, <em>Enchantment,</em> author Guy Kawasaki promotes the eye-crinkling Duchenne smile<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_10" id="B_10">10</a></sup> that will aid your likability. A smile will connect you in a positive way with viewers. It&#x2019;s the fastest way to put icing on your brand.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Hair.</span></strong> Is your hair neat and professional? Pay for a well-recommended hair salon to cut and style your hair before your photo shoot. Don&#x2019;t go cheap on the haircut. Well-cut and well-styled hair will boost your attractiveness and give you greater confidence and presence.<a id="page169" /></p>
<p><a id="page170" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Eyes.</span></strong> Are you looking directly into the camera? If your eyes look like they are focused away from the lens, you will not look as trustworthy or open.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Eyewear.</span></strong> The rule of thumb has always been to remove your glasses before a photo so there isn&#x2019;t any lighting glare and so as not to put up a barrier between you and the viewer. However, if your glasses are a key part of your visual brand, then by all means wear them. You might consider how well your eyeglass frames are representing the image you want to convey. For a more edgy look, choose a designer who is known for cutting-edge fashion. For a power look, some heavier frames may be appropriate. Pay for thinner lenses since thick, &#x201C;bottle glass&#x201D; eyewear is less attractive. If you don&#x2019;t know whether your glasses are enhancing or detracting from your image, have a professional at an optical store discuss the pros and cons of different frames that meet your needs.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Clothing and jewelry.</span></strong> For Twitter photos, I recommend doing a close crop of a photo that shows only your head, so clothes aren&#x2019;t important. However, for a head-and-shoulders shot for LinkedIn, think about what you are trying to convey. If you are trying to move up in your career, dress for the next level. If you are trying to convey a professional but more casual style, wear an open-neck shirt without a tie or jacket. Women should avoid statement necklaces and sparkly jewelry for their photos, as the focus of your photo should be on your face and not your accessories. Choose your clothing colors so that they don&#x2019;t blend into the background.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Facial makeup.</span></strong> A woman&#x2019;s makeup should enhance her beauty, not be a mask. Use a light touch with makeup so it looks natural. A little concealer dabbed under your eyes will eliminate dark circles that can make you look tired. Avoid overdone makeup&#x2014;too much blush or eye shadow or an overly dark lipstick shade will detract from your professional image.</p>
<p class="noindent">Both men and women should dust some translucent powder on their faces to reduce shine before a photo session. Your photographer may carry loose powder and a brush for this purpose.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to add more color to your photo, consider being photographed against a colored wall or backdrop. The color should be one that enhances how you look. So if tan or yellow drains the color from your face, don&#x2019;t use these colors in your background. Experiment with color and you will find shades that complement your skin tone and bring out the best in you.</p>
<p class="noindent">One of my clients was an independent management consultant who wanted to use a photo of himself on a dock with a large fish that he had caught. I understand that people would like to show some of their personality and outside interests, but, in his case, it didn&#x2019;t forward his aim of being taken seriously as a management consultant. The photo did not belong on his home page or in his LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p class="noindent">In another profile photo example, a young professional woman used a photo of herself in a sleeveless cocktail dress with her hair falling in front of her face. The cocktail dress was not appropriate business attire and her bangs hid half her face. This poor presentation led me to think that she did not have good business judgment. Hopefully your profile photo will encourage introductions and business opportunities, as opposed to discouraging them.</p>
<p class="noindent">With more people checking you out online before you meet, your profile photo may be the first impression that you give. Make sure that you look your best. And, don&#x2019;t forget to smile.</p>
