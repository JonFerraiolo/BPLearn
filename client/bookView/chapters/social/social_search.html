<h2 id="h2_5"><span class="gray">Your Google Search Results</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Right now, do a Google search on your name. What do you find?</p>
<p class="noindent">Hopefully, you show up several times in the first page of the search results. A search may show up images (such as profile photos of you), websites (such as your LinkedIn profile, blog and personal website), video (such as your YouTube posts), articles, news releases, reviews, and on and on. People who have search page results look like they matter to the world. People who don&#x2019;t appear in search results seem like nonentities. Nearly every employer expects management candidates to have social media understanding, since this is the way the world communicates and influences today.</p>
<h3><strong>You need to guide your own social image as it reflects on your professionalism and your competence in navigating modern realities.</strong></h3>
