<h2 id="h2_2"><span class="gray">Why You Need to Be in Social Media</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">If you are looking for a job or other opportunities, it is critical that you be found. So many of my clients have been hired after recruiters found them on LinkedIn. A publisher found me on LinkedIn, checked out my blog and asked me to write a book on branding. I didn&#x2019;t choose this publisher for my book, but it does illustrate that having a presence in social networking opens you to a world of opportunities. People looking for your experience or talents can find you.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to Jobvite&#x2019;s online survey<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_7" id="B_7">7</a></sup> of more than 800 human resources and recruitment professionals in the United States:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>89 percent use or planned to use social networking for recruiting</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>LinkedIn is the most dominant platform for social recruiting (87 percent usage), followed by Facebook (55 percent usage) and Twitter (46 percent usage)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>64 percent use or planned to use two or more social networks for recruiting and 40 percent use or planned to use three or more social networks for recruiting</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Even if you are not looking for a job, you can be sure that your clients, colleagues, investors or others are looking at your LinkedIn page or doing a Google search on you. If you can&#x2019;t be found or show up poorly, you may lose an important opportunity.</p>
