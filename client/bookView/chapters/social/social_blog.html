<h2 id="h2_7"><span class="gray">To Blog or Not to Blog</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Blogging is a big commitment, so I don&#x2019;t recommend starting a blog unless:</p>
<ol class="nlist">
<li><span class="orange">You have something of value to say that can continue for the life of your blog.</span></li>
<li><span class="orange">You have the time to commit to posting regularly&#x2014;once a week should be the minimum if you want to gain traction with followers. (I am guilty of letting my blog frequency slide when my client work gets too heavy, but I am working on a new editorial schedule that will keep me on track!)</span></li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">That said, blogging can be an excellent platform for your unique point of view or your thought leadership. It is also more permanent and searchable than posting on, say, Twitter. I started blogging in 2006 and now, even with my somewhat irregular postings, I have a credible compendium of blog articles on branding topics. A number of new clients have told me that my blog helped to sway them to hire me.</p>

<h3><strong>Blogs can communicate your big ideas, your core values and your personality.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you want to evangelize a vision or a way of doing business, writing a blog is an excellent vehicle. Take Tony Hsieh, the CEO of Zappos, which has grown from an online shoe retailer to a customer service organization that &#x201C;delivers happiness&#x201D; with a myriad of fashion products. Tony, who is active on Twitter and writes a blog, has been a longtime champion of customer service and culture. His values have evolved into Zappos&#x2019; present brand promise: Delivering Happiness, also the name of his book. The important thing is that Tony doesn&#x2019;t just talk about these subjects; he and his company live the core values and deliver on what they promise. I have experienced firsthand the authentically friendly customer service reps at Zappos, who make everything easy and bring a smile to your face during the encounter. What Tony did was make his vision and his beliefs public. In doing so, he not only promoted his personal brand, he provided a great lesson on business to the rest of us.</p>
