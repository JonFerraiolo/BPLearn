<h2 id="h2_9"><span class="gray">Online Reputation Management</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Managing your online reputation is something everyone should do. It can be as simple as doing a Google search on your name. Are the links and images of you that show up on the first page of search results how you want your brand represented? If not, then you have some work to do.</p>
<p class="noindent">Unfortunately, items published on the Internet have a long shelf life. However, you can populate your Internet search page results with new and brand-relevant content. Ideas include starting your own website, writing blog posts, commenting on others&#x2019; blogs, building profiles on popular platforms that rank high in Google searches (for example, LinkedIn, Google+, Facebook), distributing online news releases, and uploading content on YouTube and SlideShare. All of these activities will be found by the search engines and crowd the older items off the first page of results.</p>
<p class="noindent">You don&#x2019;t have to spend a lot of time managing the online reputation of your personal brand. Follow who mentions you in Twitter, see where you are being tagged in Facebook and sign up for Google Alerts at <a href="http://www.google.com/alerts">http://www.google.com/alerts</a>. Recently, Google Alerts made me aware that another site was infringing on my BrandingPays trademark! You certainly want to guard against someone misappropriating your name or image.</p>
