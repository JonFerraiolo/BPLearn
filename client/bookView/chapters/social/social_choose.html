<h2 id="h2_3"><span class="gray">Choose Your Social Networks</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Be selective about how you choose your social networks and how you brand on them. There are many social networks, but if you have limited time and resources, I would stick to the Big Three (with the caveat to grab your online real estate on Google+):</p>
<p><a id="page158" /></p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>LinkedIn</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Facebook</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Twitter</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">My advice is to start with LinkedIn, and you can build from there.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="gray">LinkedIn</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">LinkedIn is the social network for professionals. You need to have a complete profile on LinkedIn if you are serious about your career. I will touch on a few key areas that are important to establishing your differentiated brand on this network.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Your LinkedIn Title</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindentb">If you are looking for a job or new opportunities, use a title that provides more compelling information than just your current job title and company. See the old versus new example below:</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td class="orcell" valign="middle"><strong>Old</strong></td>
<td class="grcell" valign="top">Vice President of Corporate Marketing Widget3, Inc.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="noindentb">The title doesn&#x2019;t indicate any differentiation and the company, if not widely known, does little to enhance the personal brand.</p>
<table>
<colgroup>
<col width="30%" />
<col width="70%" />
</colgroup>
<tr>
<td class="orcell" valign="middle"><strong>New</strong></td>
<td class="grcell" valign="top">Corporate Marketing Executive&#x2014;Enterprise and Consumer Software<br/><br/>Strategic Corporate Branding, Integrated Marketing Programs, and Change Management Leadership</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p><a id="page159" /></p>
<p class="noindent">This marketing executive is differentiated by his software expertise and leadership in change management, a skill that companies undergoing culture change because of a merger, acquisition or new management will value. The strategic corporate branding and integrated marketing are included as necessary skills for a VP of corporate marketing but not necessarily differentiating. His profile will include evidence and metrics that back up his brand positioning claims.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Your Profile and Chronological Experience</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Your profile is one of the best ways to guide your brand and position your unique value with prospective employers, partners, clients or others. See <a href="chapter003.xhtml">chapter 3</a> for an example of Celia&#x2019;s messaging in her LinkedIn profile.</p>
<p class="noindent">Don&#x2019;t forget to add keywords that recruiters will search, and achievement highlights that will provide credibility for your positioning claims. Recruiters and others will search using keywords for certain experience and expertise. For technical people, it could be software languages. For managers, it could be global, language or key management skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">A civil engineering manager went from zero LinkedIn inquiries to several each month after he revised his profile. He positioned himself as a:</p>
<h4 class="h4l"><span class="gray">Consulting Engineering Manager for Civil and Environmental Infrastructure&#x2014;for municipal clients and private companies</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">His title cued recruiters that he is an engineering manager who has experience valuable to an engineering consulting firm that specializes in civil and environmental infrastructure projects. He included such keywords in his profile as &#x201C;planning, design and construction administration&#x201D; as well as such terms as &#x201C;business development, project management, client management, risk management and quality assurance.&#x201D; This engineer came up multiple times for different search criteria.</p>
<p><a id="page160" /></p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Recommendations</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Your brand is based on what others say about you, so the Recommendations section in LinkedIn is important to your credibility. LinkedIn makes it very easy to send requests for recommendations. I usually ask for a LinkedIn recommendation at the end of a consulting assignment when clients say I&#x2019;ve done great work. &#x201C;Would you mind putting that in a LinkedIn reference?&#x201D; I&#x2019;ll ask. Invariably they say yes, and then I send them a LinkedIn request with a few ideas on what their recommendation might include. If they are busy, I&#x2019;ll ask if I can paraphrase what they just told me verbally and send it to them as a draft.</p>
<p class="noindent">It makes sense to meet clients in person or to call them before sending a reference request. Connecting personally will give you an opportunity to refresh their memories (if necessary) on what you worked on together and the results. Your meeting will also afford you an opportunity to update them on your current positioning. Do show interest in their updates and ask how you can help them in their pursuits. Perhaps you can recommend them on LinkedIn.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Groups</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">You probably already have networks within LinkedIn. By virtue of your membership or association with these groups, you will have more credibility in these networks. You should add your viewpoints to existing discussions or start your own. Follow the discussions for a while before jumping in so that you understand the etiquette of posting in each group. Examples of LinkedIn groups you can join include:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Colleges and universities where you are an alumnus or alumna</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Professional organizations (e.g., Interactive &#x0026; Digital Media Group and American Marketing Association)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Special interest groups (e.g., Nonfiction Authors Network and BlogHer)</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page161" /></p>
<p class="noindent">If there isn&#x2019;t a group with your interest or expertise, consider starting your own LinkedIn group. It is an instant way to position yourself as an expert and as someone who is giving back by organizing a group that will benefit those who share your interests.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Links</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Be sure to include personal branding URLs here, such as Twitter, Facebook, your blog, your website, your YouTube channel or other sites. One of my clients had several links with different names that served to confuse her brand. We cleaned up her links and included only those that reinforced her brand name.</p>
<p class="noindent">The more complete you can make your LinkedIn profile, the better for being found in searches and providing a rounded view of your personal brand.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="gray">Facebook</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Facebook is a network that blends your social life and, if you allow it, your work life on one platform.</p>
<h3><strong>Whereas LinkedIn is a more buttoned-down view of you (mainly your cake), Facebook allows a more rounded picture (more icing).</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">You can control who sees your posts, friends, photos and profile, but do know that recruiters and hiring companies can find creative ways to get access to your full Facebook persona.</p>
<p class="noindent">According to a Reppler survey of 300 hiring professionals, 91 percent said they use social networking sites to screen job candidates. Therefore, even if you think Facebook is for only friends and family, prospective employers will check to see how you show up in social media. Your Facebook page provides clues to your character, values and judgment.</p>
<p><a id="page162" /></p>
<p class="noindent">A more shocking statistic from the Reppler survey is that 69 percent of respondents said that they rejected candidates based on content found on the candidate&#x2019;s social networking profile. Being tagged in a bachelor party photo drinking alcohol with scantily clad women may not be the image that you want a prospective employer or client to see. Likewise, a prospective employer or investor may be offended by your political rant on social media. &#x201C;But, I want to be my authentic self,&#x201D; you say. There are plenty of opportunities to show your authentic self and personality that won&#x2019;t put off potential employers. Make a conscious choice each time you post. If you wonder whether this could come back to haunt you, it is probably a good idea to share this thought or photo in person rather than through social media.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you want to open up your Facebook network beyond friends and family to your business acquaintances and others, you will want to use the Facebook privacy controls, which are not very user-friendly. <strong><span class="orange">TIP</span></strong> (based on Facebook&#x2019;s user interface at time of researching this book): Click on the Facebook logo to get to the home page, and select &#x201C;Friends,&#x201D; then click on &#x201C;MORE.&#x201D; On the Friends page, you can click on the &#x201C;Create Lists&#x201D; button to segment your Facebook audiences. Then, before you post on Facebook, you can use the Friends drop-down menu to choose the lists to which you want to post.</p>
<p class="noindent">In addition to your personal page, you can have a Facebook page for your business. People are interested in interacting with people, not faceless companies, so the more you can do to put a human face on your business page, the better. Showing real people in videos and photos, and commenting in personable language on posts, will humanize your company and underscore your values. Be careful about using your Facebook business page solely for promoting your products&#x2014;no one wants to feel sold to constantly. It is fine to run promotions via Facebook, but you also need to provide informational and entertainment value. Give people a reason to &#x201C;like&#x201D; your page and to want to return. Keep the content fresh, engaging and valuable.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="gray">Twitter</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Twitter is a micro-blogging network that allows you to post &#x201C;tweets&#x201D; of 140 characters. You can follow people whose posts you like and others can follow you. Many are attracted to the real-time nature of Twitter streams, which allow you to follow hot trending subjects and discover fresh information on <a id="page163" />topics that interest you. I use Twitter to bolster my &#x201C;branding guru&#x201D; image. Therefore, I tweet almost exclusively about branding topics&#x2014;both corporate branding and personal branding.</p>
<p class="noindent">Do you have to use Twitter to have an online personal brand? No, but it is a lot easier to gain followers on Twitter than it is with your personal blog, which could take some time to build a following.</p>
<h3><strong>Focusing 90 percent of your tweets on business or your area of expertise, and 10 percent on personal tweets, is probably a good rule of thumb.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you currently have a Twitter account and have not used it effectively for personal branding, consider repositioning yourself on Twitter by changing your profile to emphasize your focus (mainly cake, with some icing). Then, tweet accordingly. Follow some Twitter influencers in your chosen space, retweet their posts and engage them in conversation as appropriate. Their followers and other people who share your interests will find you, and you will grow your following. Don&#x2019;t forget to follow people back and comment on or retweet their tweets. When people retweet your Twitter postings, it is common courtesy to thank them publicly, thereby giving them more Twitter exposure.</p>
<p class="noindent">You can use hashtags to help folks follow the conversation around a certain topic, such as &#x0023;brandingpays, or an event. Often organizers of my speaking events will notify attendees of the hashtag for the event so participants can tweet their thoughts or quotes during my talk. If you want to check out existing hashtags, go to <a href="http://www.hashtag.org">www.hashtag.org</a>.</p>
<p class="noindent">There are many tools that can help you to manage your Twitter account. I like using HootSuite, a tool that lets me see all of the topics and people I am following in a visual dashboard. HootSuite allows me to send my posts to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Google+ and other social networks separately or simultaneously. This tool will allow you to schedule your posts so that they will automatically be sent throughout the day or even weeks ahead <a id="page164" />(especially useful if you have evergreen content that can be spread out over time). If you post frequently and consistently about your topic of choice, you will become known in that space. You will gain a reputation and enhance your brand.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="gray">Google+</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Google+ is a newer social networking platform that many social media influencers, such as best-selling author Guy Kawasaki, are advocating. It&#x2019;s like a cross between Facebook and Twitter, and enables easy segmenting of your posts to different &#x201C;circles.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">Guy Kawasaki said on a talk show that Facebook is about talking to the people you went to high school with and Google+ is about talking to the people you wished you went to high school with.<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_8" id="B_8">8</a></sup> That may be a simplistic and not totally accurate view, but it does differentiate Facebook&#x2019;s origins of being school-friend-centric.</p>
<p class="noindent">However, a BrandingPays pulse survey<sup><a href="notes.xhtml#A_9" id="B_9">9</a></sup> of 384 professionals (mainly in Silicon Valley) found that Facebook and LinkedIn were by far the most prevalent networks used for personal branding. Of our respondents, 51 percent said they use Facebook all the time or often, and some 41 percent said the same of LinkedIn. Likewise, 12 percent said they never used LinkedIn and 16 percent said they never used Facebook. However, 61 percent of respondents said they never used Google+ for personal branding. We&#x2019;ll see how this changes over time.</p>
<p class="noindent">Even if your mainstream audience is not on Google+, they will be eventually. Why? Because Google is the big gorilla of search. If you want to be found, you should have some presence on Google+. At the very least, grab your personal Google URL, which is a great segue to my next section.</p>
