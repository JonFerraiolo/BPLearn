<h2 class="h2">Portable Branding and Social Media: Getting Started</h2>
<p class="noindent">The social media tips in this section are for beginners, since I have encountered so many professionals and entrepreneurs who need the basics. If you are already proficient in social media, this chapter can be a reminder to align your online persona and activities with your brand strategy, or you can skip this chapter entirely.</p>
<p class="noindent">The BrandingPays System focuses on developing your strategies and messages for a compelling brand. Social media is a tactic, but many people think personal branding and social media are nearly synonymous.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x201C;I tweet, therefore, I brand.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">True to an extent, but the real question is: Will you be known for the right things? So many people in social media are sending out mixed signals that make their brands unclear. People that I follow on Twitter tweet on specific topics. Through the consistency of their messages, they have built credibility as experts. However, there are many more who tweet on any subject under the sun. Yes, they have ubiquitous tweets, but there is little value for their followers, unless you like random posts.</p>
<h3><strong>Social networking through digital means is here to stay.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Even if you are late to the game, now is as good a time as ever to jump in. Every day things are changing in social media&#x2014;there are new platforms, new ways that people are connecting and sharing. The rules are being rewritten while we speak.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you aren&#x2019;t convinced that you need a social brand&#x2014;that is, a brand in social media&#x2014;please read on.</p>
