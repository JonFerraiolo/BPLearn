<h2 id="h2_8"><span class="gray">Should You Promote Your Personal Brand or Your Business Brand Online?</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Sometimes your personal brand <em>is</em> your business brand, as in the case of independent consultants who go by their personal names in business. However, if you have a business brand that is different from your personal name, you still need to have a personal brand.</p>
<p class="noindent">Your personal brand may not always be tied to your current company. If you are an entrepreneur and you and your company part ways, you need a credible personal brand that can stand on its own as you look to start and fund your next venture. Don&#x2019;t let the VCs or anyone else be the sole shaper of your reputation and image.</p>
<p class="noindent">A client of mine who is a partner in an international law firm has a plan to be on the boards of large companies in his last few years in law and beyond. One of the ways he is preparing for that transition is using his personal <a id="page172" />blog to write articles that leverage his law expertise in the broader context of business goals and corporate compliance. He wisely is developing a reputation that is not solely tied to his law firm.</p>
<p class="noindent">A CEO client who has a start-up company posts on Twitter under his own name as well as having company employees tweet under the company&#x2019;s Twitter account. The CEO&#x2019;s Twitter account shares his passion for open data that goes beyond his company, providing both an intellectual and an emotional connection with his followers.</p>
