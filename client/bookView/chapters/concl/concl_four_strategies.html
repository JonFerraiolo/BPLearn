<h2 id="h2_2"><span class="gray">Four Stories on Overcoming Challenges in Personal Branding and Life</span></h2>
<h4><span class="gray">Sherry</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Sherry is an African American woman whose parents moved to California after college to avoid the discrimination that they&#x2019;d experienced in the South. Both of her parents joined large companies and worked hard throughout their careers (one in insurance and the other in retail) to achieve executive roles. Sherry&#x2019;s mother told her young daughter that she needed to be twice as good as her non-black counterparts to get ahead. Bias, she said, continued to exist, as too many people have lingering doubts about promoting blacks as business leaders. Sherry&#x2019;s own parents were often the token person of color in the ranks of upper management.<a id="page179" /></p>
<p><a id="page180" /></p>
<p class="noindent">In 2000, Sherry joined a big biotechnology company as a staff member in Human Resources. She held a variety of positions in staffing and college programs over the next couple of years, and began expanding her responsibilities in the area of diversity. During this time, the company had a critical need for a wider pool of hiring candidates trained in biotech manufacturing. To address this need, Sherry designed and implemented an enterprise program with state workforce boards and local professors to offer a Biotechnology Certificate Program through community colleges. The innovative program, funded by the Department of Labor, was so successful that she testified on Capitol Hill on how the program was achieved.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sherry completed her master&#x2019;s degree in Organizational Development while working full time and was promoted in 2008 as the director of diversity and inclusion. Despite her apparent career success, she lacked confidence in her new job and felt that management continued to view her as a college programs manager. For the first time, she received a less-than-exemplary review that included critical feedback.</p>
<p class="noindent">She decided to take action to improve. Sherry enrolled in a six-month leadership skills course and immersed herself in education about diversity, compliance and other subjects key to her performance and diversity expertise.</p>
<p class="noindent">She took other steps to rebrand herself as a diversity leader. Sherry believed that if she could design and implement an important diversity initiative, her brand would be tied to the program&#x2019;s success. She developed the next generation of workforce strategies and programs to retain and develop women and people of color in science and technology functions. She set goals and milestones, and educated partners and influencers. Two years into the initiative, the company is on track to meet its objectives.</p>
<p class="noindent">Sherry grew to be a better leader and a better brand by facing her setbacks, learning from her mistakes and taking steps to reach her potential. She did not give in to doubts about her abilities because of her gender, race or background.</p>
<h3><strong>When the little voice of doubt started nagging at her and eroding her confidence, she acknowledged it but did not let it grow.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">She was the inspirational speaker at a recent corporate event attended by more than 200 employees and key executive leaders, including the company CEO. Today, Sherry is seen as <em>the</em> diversity leader at her company and a shining example of the company&#x2019;s own diversity policies.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Ahmad</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Ahmad, a gay Malaysian immigrant, is a business banking executive in a large San Francisco bank. His personal branding journey is a testament to his drive and determination to succeed despite the odds.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ahmad was born in a poor Muslim village in Malaysia to an illiterate mother who worked in a factory on a rubber plantation and a father who worked in a sawmill. Ahmad and his five siblings lived in a house with no running water or electricity. It was a struggle to keep food on the table and adequate clothing on the children.</p>
<p class="noindent">Education was Ahmad&#x2019;s ticket out of poverty. His siblings, who lacked his ambition, are still in Malaysia working in farming and factory jobs. The only one in his family to speak a foreign language, Ahmad learned English so he could get a job as a waiter at a Malaysian resort. He spent seven years in hospitality in Malaysia and Vietnam before working with an international agent to find an assistant finance job in a fancy California hotel and resort on the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p class="noindent">Tired of resorts nestled in trees, Ahmad became a front office manager for a San Francisco hotel. Soon after the 9/11 terrorist attack that destroyed the World Trade Center, he lost his job because travel and tourism dried up in the aftermath. He started working morning and night shifts in two different jobs to survive financially. He began thinking of his future. Ahmad decided to leave the uncertainty of hospitality and forge a new career in banking based on his sales and financial analysis skills.</p>
<p><a id="page181" /></p>
<p class="noindent">A contact within a large San Francisco bank told him about some sales openings in personal banking and provided him with a reference. Each time Ahmad went for interviews, he met with a Caucasian executive who looked at him skeptically. What they saw was someone from hospitality who had no banking experience, who looked and sounded foreign with a strange name and accent, and who had an effeminate voice and body language. According to Ahmad, the bank organization was open to diversity but the actual employees held their own personal biases. He was rejected for three separate jobs. Finally, in his fourth and final try, he found a female executive willing to give him a chance. He got a job as a personal banking officer.</p>
<h3><strong>Ahmad knew he had to prove himself and worked doubly hard to exceed the expectations of those who harbored doubts about his ability.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">He took every personal development and banking course that his bank offered. His friendly personality, sense of humor and excellent customer service skills from his hospitality experience won over new banking customers. While working full time, Ahmad went to college at night and finished his degree in business administration with honors. He will also soon be taking his test to become a U.S. citizen. The bank recognized his industry and track record, and he repeatedly won awards as a top producer. After three promotions, he is currently an assistant vice president in business banking.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ahmad has faced discrimination in Malaysia for coming from a poor family and for being gay in a strict Muslim community. He has faced bias as a short Asian man, an immigrant with an accent, a Muslim in America, a gay outsider, and a business banker who lacks an MBA degree. His advice?</p>
<h3><strong>Change what you can, but don&#x2019;t dwell on things you can&#x2019;t change or control.</strong></h3>
<p><a id="page182" /></p>
<p class="noindent">He believes that people have control over 90 percent of their personal brand, and this is where you should put your focus. Ahmad has learned to take risks and to stretch himself in his career. He already has his sights on his next career move in banking that will leverage his trilingual capabilities and his international experience. He is building his r&#x00E9;sum&#x00E9; and shifting his brand to position himself for the next chapter in his amazing story.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><span class="gray">Modesta</span></h4>
<p class="noindent">Modesta was the fifth out of six daughters born to Mexican-Americans who started their life as farm workers in East Texas. Her mother rose early each morning to make tortillas and pack lunches for the family workers. She then went to pick cotton in the hot sun&#x2014;even when she was pregnant.</p>
<h3><strong>Modesta&#x2019;s parents had no formal education. They wished for a better life for their children.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The ultimate dream was a high school diploma for each of their daughters. College, a standard milestone for middle-class children, was not even a consideration.</p>
<p class="noindent">When Modesta was old enough for high school, she moved in with her sister and brother-in-law and took care of their children. Modesta attended a small Catholic high school where many of the students&#x2019; parents were the town&#x2019;s business owners and power brokers. The expectations for the students of color&#x2014;less than a dozen at her school&#x2014;were not high. In fact, on the day that college representatives visited their high school, neither Modesta nor the other students of color were invited to attend.</p>
<p class="noindent">When she graduated from high school, Modesta moved in with relatives in California. As a Latina and the daughter of manual laborers, she was conditioned to have low expectations for her life. However, she enrolled in the local community college and found a mentor, a Mexican-American educator who changed her life. He saw in her promise that no one else had seen. He encouraged her to run for president of La Raza, the Chicano student group he advised. She wanted to be of service, so she worked hard to get over her painful shyness and won the election. Modesta gained new confidence and has never looked back.</p>
<p><a id="page183" /></p>
<p><a id="page184" /></p>
<p class="noindent">With the help of multiple college mentors who convinced her that she was smart and capable, and as a Ford Foundation Scholar, she transferred to the University of Santa Clara and studied in Europe. She later attended Harvard University for her master&#x2019;s in Education. Throughout her life, Modesta had few role models and, at times, felt the sting of bias as a Latina in a white man&#x2019;s world. In spite of her humble background and cultural challenges, she succeeded.</p>
<p class="noindent">Princeton University hired her as an admissions officer, starting her on a career path in counseling and college admissions. In her long career, Harvard and national organizations have recognized Modesta for service leadership in education. She has always had a passion for service, and recently retired from her job as a community college academic and career counselor. Helping community college students&#x2014;especially multicultural students&#x2014;to dream big was her way of giving back and honoring all of the mentors who had believed in her when she was young.</p>
<p class="noindent">Modesta has now started her second act. She founded her own college admissions counseling business and is learning to rebrand as an entrepreneur. We worked together on her brand positioning as an independent counselor and coach for college admissions. In addition to her Ivy League experience, she has consulted in Asia on college planning and admissions. Few college admissions consultants can match her cake: a Latina with strong educational counseling credentials, Ivy League education and admissions experience, and placement success with diverse students, including students of color and international students. Her icing is her empathy and her passion for serving the underrepresented in particular, and the global student demographic in general. Modesta has proven that professional ambitions and cultural values do not have to be mutually exclusive.</p>
<h3><strong>Modesta has a tip for those who want a higher-visibility brand: engage in <em>meaningful volunteerism.</em></strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">She volunteers tirelessly as a counselor, speaker and organizer for myriad groups that serve underrepresented communities. She spent years organizing programs with her local alumni group, the Harvard Club, and was rewarded with the top leadership position. It was no small feat given that she was the first person of color and only the third woman to be elected president of this former bastion of white men. Thanks to Modesta&#x2019;s leadership, her area&#x2019;s Harvard Club now has a diverse board. This visibility and credibility as a counselor and speaker has enabled her to serve youth, with the unexpected benefit of enhanced job choices and key business connections.</p>
<h3><strong>Modesta went from a shy girl who thought menial labor was her destiny to being a force for change in the Ivy League.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">Her story is an inspiration for anyone who must overcome challenges to achieve a desired brand.</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Doreen</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Doreen Woo Ho is a former <em>Time</em> magazine foreign correspondent and longtime banking executive with Citicorp, Wells Fargo and United Commercial Bank, where she served as president and CEO. While retired from any operating roles in banking, she is currently an independent director on the board of directors of US Bancorp. She is also the president of the San Francisco Port Commission that oversees the 7.5 miles of San Francisco waterfront, including many real estate development projects. She is a graduate of Smith College and Columbia University.</p>
<p class="noindent">What follows is her story and advice for Asian Americans on success in personal branding.</p>
<h4 class="h4" style="margin-bottom:0em; font-size:100%;"><span class="orange">Doreen&#x2019;s Story</span></h4>
<p class="noindent0">Doreen was born in Australia to a Taiwanese diplomat and his wife. After living in Sydney for eight years and attending an English-speaking school, she moved to Taiwan, where her father had been reposted. Going from a highly developed Western economy and standard of living to the relative undeveloped environment of Taiwan was shocking. Instead of cars, there were people-powered pedicabs. Instead of indoor toilets, there were outhouses with no plumbing. Because her parents had spoken English at home in Australia, Doreen and her older brother had to learn Chinese. Despite the difficulties she faced, Doreen remembers her time in Taiwan as a happy one.</p>
<p><a id="page185" /></p>
<p class="noindent">After three years in Taiwan, her father moved the family to his new diplomatic post in Tokyo, where they lived for a year. Then, her father was posted to West Africa as the ambassador to Cameroon and Togo. Thinking that the West Africa post was temporary and concerned about the lack of good schools, the parents sent Doreen and her brother to boarding schools in the United States. Little did Doreen know that she would not see her parents again for five years! Taiwanese diplomatic salaries were low, and the family could not afford the costly travel between West Africa and the United States.</p>
<p class="noindent">Thus, Doreen became independent at the age of 13. Luckily, her family circumstances made her readily adaptable to change. She always saw moving as a new adventure. A fortune-teller once told her mother that Doreen&#x2019;s personality was &#x201C;like a rolling stone with no moss.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">The stereotype of Asians, Doreen says, is that they avoid risks. In her own career, she has taken a number of them. Instead of continuing in a safe job with a bank, she accepted a job at the age of 22 as a Vietnam War correspondent in Cambodia, resulting from a chance meeting with the Time magazine bureau chief at a cocktail party. &#x201C;I guess I made a good impression,&#x201D; she says of the subsequent job offer she received.</p>
<p class="noindent">She again took a risk with her then-husband to relocate back to the United States instead of Asia just before the fall of Cambodia and Saigon. She was accepted into Citibank&#x2019;s management training program and chose to enroll in the program in San Francisco. A cross-country move might not seem daunting if you have been a &#x201C;rolling stone&#x201D; for most of your life.</p>
<p class="noindent">Doreen&#x2019;s adaptability and ability to make big decisions were on display even when she was an undergraduate at Smith College, an elite all-women&#x2019;s college in Massachusetts. A Life magazine article on human reproduction had inspired her to major in biochemistry, but by her junior year, she was tired of the time spent alone in a lab. She realized that she was a people person and switched to being a history major.</p>
<p class="noindent">Ivy League schools were all-male institutions when she went to Smith, and she recalls that most of the Smith students seemed more interested in getting married than in pursuing a career. However, Doreen had greater ambitions. She has always had the need to move forward, use her brain and be challenged in ways that being a stay-at-home mom could never satisfy. Yet she is the proud mother of three children, all college graduates and <a id="page186" />pursuing their own careers. She readily admits that a helpful husband and a housekeeper assisted her in managing a demanding executive career and family life.</p>
<p class="noindent">There is a time and a place for everything. Doreen&#x2019;s career was not a straight trajectory to the top. &#x201C;Careers zigzag. I consciously chose some lateral staff positions to reduce the amount of travel and my workload,&#x201D; she says of juggling career and young children. &#x201C;I tell people it&#x2019;s okay to do that.&#x201D;</p>
<h4 class="h4"><strong><span class="orange">Asian Americans Can Overcome Personal Branding Challenges</span></strong></h4>
<p class="noindent">Personal branding can be a challenge for anyone, but it can be especially hard for Asians.</p>
<h3><strong>Changing the racial stereotype of Asians as meek geeks requires that they be more visible, stronger leaders and better at self-marketing.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">The latter is hard for many Asians who have been taught that humility, quiet deference and respect for authority are key values.</p>
<p class="noindent">American business icons often have big personalities, big egos and aren&#x2019;t afraid of confrontation or risk. Think of Steve Jobs, Larry Ellison, and on a gentler vector, Oprah Winfrey. But when I think about iconic Asian business leaders, my mind draws a blank. Why aren&#x2019;t Asian business leaders household names? In a nutshell, they lack powerful personal brands.</p>
<p class="noindent">I asked Doreen how Asians can overcome personal branding challenges.</p>
<p class="noindent">She advises Asians to get outside the stereotype of the passive worker who is good at numbers but not so good with people or management skills. They should be proud of their culture and heritage, she says, but not make being Asian the prime identifier of their brand.</p>
<p><a id="page187" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Her personal branding advice is important for anyone, regardless of race, gender or cultural heritage:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>You are a professional, who just happens to be Asian or a woman or&#x2026;</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Welcome change and new challenges.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Hone your written and verbal skills. You&#x2019;ve got to be able to sell your ideas.</p>
</div>
<h3><strong>Learn to transition from being an excellent doer to an excellent leader who achieves through inspiring and motivating others.</strong></h3>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>It takes more than IQ (intelligence quotient) and EQ (emotional quotient) to be a strong leader&#x2014;add the third ingredient, MQ (meaningful quotient). Help people understand how they fit into the vision and the value they bring as an individual.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Don&#x2019;t just focus on getting your job done; spend time on relating to people and cultivating relationships&#x2014;especially with career influencers.</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>When you climb the executive ladder, understand that the intangible attributes become more important (how strategically you think, how you solve problems, how you lead).</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Develop an ease of socializing inside and outside the office. Breaking into the inner circle of executives is more about personal chemistry and homogeneous backgrounds. Executives feel more comfortable around people who share common experiences.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">Finally, Doreen says, don&#x2019;t let racial or other stereotypes get you down&#x2014;focus on doing your job. Doreen was almost kept from traveling to South America to handle some client problems because she was thought of as the &#x201C;China doll&#x201D; by her customer, a VP of Finance at a sizable private company. He believed that she couldn&#x2019;t hold her own in the macho environment of Brazil and Venezuela. She took the trip with another male executive and fixed the problem. Ironically, the local bank officers at the Citibank branches that she dealt with in South America were all women! So much for stereotypes.</p>
<p><a id="page188" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Doreen hopes that others characterize her leadership brand as:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>An inspiring and visionary leader who sets stretch goals</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>A tough manager who takes on challenges and delivers results</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>A caring leader who mentors others</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">She derives great satisfaction from having mentored a number of professionals, including those reaching the C-suite in large companies. She advises young professionals that mentors choose their mentees based on a personal or professional connection. Mentees don&#x2019;t get to choose their mentors unless there is a mutual benefit, she says.</p>
<p class="orline"></p>
<h2><span class="gray">Final Words of Advice</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">&#x201C;You have to develop a brand because everyone needs to develop a brand to be successful,&#x201D; Doreen advises. &#x201C;You have to have all the qualities. You have to look the part, look professional and be pleasant. You have to have the communication skills.&#x201D; She says that Asian parents stress math skills with their children and spend less time on encouraging good written and verbal skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">&#x201C;You may have the best content in the world &#x2026; but you have to figure out how to sell and communicate it in a way that people will buy and appreciate it.&#x201D; The same can be said of personal brands.</p>
