	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>Personal branding&#x2014;that is, creating your image and guiding your reputation&#x2014;has never been more important than it is today.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>Why?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>Because globalization and social media have made the world smaller, more connected and infinitely more competitive.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>Your competition for a job or business opportunity may be anywhere in the world&#x2014;at the desk next to you or continents away.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>It has never been more important to differentiate yourself from the pack.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>My own corporate and personal branding business provides a great example of how everyone is competing for jobs and clients globally.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>Years ago, most of my service providers and clients were within a 20-mile radius of my Palo Alto, California, office.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>Today, I use a webmaster in Kuwait, a programming team in India and Los Angeles and a PR firm in Texas, and have clients in Asia, South America, Europe and throughout the United States.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>Word-of-mouth references are important, but so is one&#x2019;s web presence&#x2014;being found by search engines and standing out in a crowded and noisy market.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>In addition to global competition, there has been a tidal change in how new technologies have affected our businesses and lives.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>I now rely on such technologies as social media, web services for collaboration, cloud storage, videocasting, ebooks and webinars that were not in my vocabulary 10 years ago.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>Instead of listening to CDs and broadcast radio, I listen to music and podcasts on my iPhone or use a web music service.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>Instead of going to a brick-and-mortar bank, I use my smartphone for deposits, transfers and paying bills.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>In every industry, old ways of doing things are being replaced by new ways.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>What does all this change mean for you?</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>There is a tremendous opportunity to position your personal brand to take advantage of the shifts in the business landscape.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>It&#x2019;s not good enough to maintain the status quo.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>Just as businesses need to reinvent themselves for new markets, you need to reinvent yourself for new career opportunities.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'>Pumping up the volume with a purely tactical approach may create awareness of your current brand, but it may not entice anyone to offer you a new opportunity.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>You need to be strategic. Reinventing your brand for new opportunities requires an understanding of market forces, your own assets and how you need to be positioned in the new world order.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='60'>Think of yourself as a free agent&#x2014;no one else is looking out for your best interests but yourself.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'>You need to be crystal clear about who you are and the value you bring to a world where constant change is the only norm.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'>If you want to stay competitive, you need to ask: Do I have a personal brand that gives me an advantage in today&#x2019;s world?</a>
</p>
<h3><a data-bp-start-time='69'><strong>In short, brand yourself, or be left behind.</strong></a></h3>
<h2><a data-bp-start-time='72'><span class="gray">Anyone Can Master Personal Branding</span></a></h2>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='75'>Personal branding is not rocket science.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='78'>Creating the image that defines your unique value is something anyone can master. It&#x2019;s not just the purview of branding gurus and social media mavens.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='81'>Unfortunately, few understand what it takes to build a strong brand&#x2014;online or offline. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='84'>Some may be defeating themselves by promoting a weak image and a me-too message to an audience that doesn&#x2019;t care.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='87'>The best companies go through a rigorous process to develop the strategy to market and brand their products.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='90'>But, as individuals, we often lack the understanding, the process or the tools to develop a strong brand strategy.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='93'>I wrote <em>BrandingPays</em>&#x2122;<em>: The Five-Step System to Reinvent Your Personal Brand</em> to fill this need.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='96'>The focus of it is on building a brand positioning strategy and developing your image and key messages, but it also includes many practical tips for implementation.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='99'>I want to help you feel confident in branding yourself.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='102'>Personal branding is a skill that will pay huge dividends throughout your life and career.</a>
