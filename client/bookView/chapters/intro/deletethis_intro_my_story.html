	<a data-bp-start-time='0'>I&#x2019;d like to share my story with you in the hope that you will be inspired to develop your own brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='3'>At the end of this book, I&#x2019;ve also included a number of inspirational stories of people who have succeeded in business and personal branding in spite of being seen as outliers.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='6'>My roots are humble.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='9'>I am a Korean American who grew up on a small family farm.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='12'>In the early 1900s, my grandfather was recruited from Korea to work the sugar cane fields in Hawaii.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='15'>My grandmother, from whom I got my independent nature, ran away from her affluent home in Pusan, Korea, to escape an arranged marriage.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='18'>When her audacious dream of a university education did not pan out, she became a &#x201C;picture bride&#x201D; to my grandfather, a perfect stranger.</a> 
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='21'>My dad was a high school dropout with tough-guy tendencies and my mom was a well-read and artistic soul.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='24'>(I guess opposites attract!)</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='27'>They were an unlikely couple to become farmers, something they knew nothing about.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='30'>But it was hard to say no to my grandmother, the one-time picture bride and family matriarch.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='33'>She believed that Dad, who was a pushover beneath his bad-boy image, should leave his job as a merchant seaman and buy a farm in Oregon for a better life for his young family. And so it was.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='36'>As a family, we planted and hoed cabbage fields, picked strawberries and tended to our sometimes struggling farm.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='39'>For entertainment, I grew up playing with mud pies and exploring the backwoods.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='42'>We had riding horses, but there were no ballets, no operas or violin concertos in our provincial lives.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='45'>We were a happy family, but I dreamed of a life beyond our little farm.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='48'>When I was seventeen, I got a scholarship to attend Mills College, a private all-women&#x2019;s college, in Oakland, California, which I later learned was where my mother had hoped to go to school.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='51'>What I loved about Mills, beyond its proximity to the cultural delights of San Francisco, was its diverse community and the philosophy that women could become whatever they wanted.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='54'>Mills encouraged me to follow my passion and make a difference in the world.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='57'>This belief has become the bedrock for my personal brand.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='60'>You could argue that I am the poster child for reinventing one&#x2019;s personal brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='63'>I started my career with newspaper journalism jobs beginning with an internship at a newspaper in Paris (France) during my junior year abroad.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='66'>I did a stint as a reporter at <em>The (Portland) Oregonian</em> soon after graduation from Mills.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='69'>Hoping to land a reporting job on the East Coast, I attended Boston University&#x2019;s graduate program in journalism.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='72'>My BU degree and Oregonian clip file helped me to get a newspaper reporting job just outside of Boston.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='75'>I must have done a good job of branding myself because, to my knowledge, I was the only one in my Master&#x2019;s program who had a job offer at graduation.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='78'>(However, my BU colleagues did get journalism jobs later.)</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='81'>Returning to California after two years in Boston, I participated in the exciting growth of high tech marketing as a practitioner and later as an executive with agencies for public relations and advertising.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='84'>I helped launch new companies and positioned them for successful initial public offerings (like Maxtor, which is now a Seagate brand), introduced industry-changing technologies and participated in creating new markets.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='87'> Each time I changed jobs, I had to reposition myself to be seen of value to my new employers. </a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='90'>For example. I have positioned myself at various times as a former journalist turned PR pro, a PR exec who could sell new programs to advertising clients, an ad agency exec with integrated marketing leadership, and a marketing strategist who could bridge strategies to implementation.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='93'>Today, through my client work and social media reputation, I am positioned as a brand strategist for corporate and personal branding.</a>
</p>
<h4 class="h4"><a data-bp-start-time='96'><span class="gray">Building on the Thought Leadership of Regis McKenna and Geoffrey Moore</span></a></h4>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='99'>My real fortune was being hired by Regis McKenna Inc. (RMI), the eponymous firm of the marketing and brand guru, which did landmark brand positioning for Apple, Intel and Genentech.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='102'>My orientation included being embedded in RMI&#x2019;s Apple account team to learn first-hand the secrets of an Apple product launch.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='105'>Many of these proven techniques&#x2014;such as positioning, messaging and influencer (ecosystem) briefings&#x2014;have been optimized for personal branding in the BrandingPays&#x2122; System.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='108'>To prove that nothing is new under the sun, I have built upon these techniques as well as the positioning and relationship marketing concepts that were originally conceived by Regis McKenna, a true marketing visionary.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='111'>During my six years doing strategy consulting at RMI as a principal and partner, I enjoyed working with many of the best and the brightest consultants and clients.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='114'>One of the RMI partners was Geoffrey Moore, the best-selling author of the marketing classic <em>Crossing the Chasm.</em></a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='117'>Geoff and I teamed on a number of strategy consulting projects at RMI.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='120'>I am happy to say I&#x2019;m still learning from him during our friendly breakfasts at Buck&#x2019;s in Woodside, California.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='123'>One of the most dramatic rebranding examples in my life occurred during my venture into the Italian vacation business in 2004.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='126'>During a two-year hiatus from Silicon Valley marketing consulting, I became co-founder and president of an Italian vacation company (our tagline: &#x201C;Savor the Real Italy&#x201D;).</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='129'>I immersed myself in everything Italian&#x2014;language, culture, fashion, food and travel&#x2014;and became trusted as an Italy expert among friends and potential clients.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='132'>Building a successful brand in Italian travel taught me that personal branding and company branding are synergistic, especially if you are an entrepreneur.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='135'>I came back to consulting because, as a recent entrepreneur, I wanted to help other entrepreneurs understand the importance and power of branding their businesses and themselves.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='138'>I created the BrandingPays System first for companies, but soon understood its applicability to people.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='141'>The fact that I work with both companies and individuals is a plus. I can bring the discipline of corporate branding to individuals and the consumer and social media insights from personal branding to companies.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='144'>Over my career, I&#x2019;ve consulted to or trained more than 150 companies&#x2014;from Fortune 500 to start-up firms&#x2014;and thousands of professionals on developing a compelling brand.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='147'>The BrandingPays System has helped many individuals get their dream job or accelerate their career success.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='150'>My dream is that all professionals learn both the art and science of personal branding, because it will yield dividends throughout their lifetime.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='153'>Personal branding is not as easy as filling in the blanks.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='156'>If you truly want to stand out, you will have to be aware of your environment (the market, the trends and the competitive opportunities) and think critically about what assets you have and how to leverage them to your advantage.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='159'>If you are willing to put in the time and effort, you will be richly rewarded.</a> 
	<a data-bp-start-time='162'>A strong personal brand can help you get a job, a promotion, investor funding or new clients.</a>
</p>
<p>
	<a data-bp-start-time='165'>Your brand is arguably your most important asset. Isn&#x2019;t it worth investing in?</a>
