<p class="noindent">Sam is an independent consultant who goes to a lot of networking events to drum up new business. He&#x2019;s a personable guy who has no trouble approaching a stranger and starting a conversation. He will chat for a few minutes, exchange business cards, then move on to someone new.</p>
<p class="noindent">The trouble is that he can&#x2019;t define what he does in a clear and memorable way. Sam is a consultant who wants to be all things to all people. He says he does market research, market segmentation strategies, pricing, sales training and copywriting. After people meet him, they don&#x2019;t remember what he does or why they should ever call him.</p>
<p class="noindent">When you meet people for the first time, they will remember only one or two things about who you are. What do you want to leave them with?</p>
<p class="noindent">Contrast Sam&#x2019;s example with an experience with my dentist, who started my latest exam with &#x201C;I know you are the branding expert, and I wanted to know &#x2026;&#x201D; When your dentist nails your positioning, you know that you are doing a good job of brand messaging.</p>
<p class="noindent">The root of Sam&#x2019;s messaging problem is that his positioning category is not clear. Is he a marketing consultant, a pricing specialist, a sales trainer or a copywriter? If you are not clear on your positioning strategy, go back to <a href="chapter002.xhtml">chapter 2</a>, because without a clear category and differentiated value, you won&#x2019;t be able to develop compelling messages.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you have a solid positioning strategy, you&#x2019;re ready to start on BrandingPays Step 2, which is where we develop the key messages that will be used in all of our verbal communications&#x2014;both written and spoken.</p>
<p class="noindent">The words you choose to describe yourself and what you offer are important. If the words are clear and compelling, they will resonate with your target audience. Your messages should articulate your positioning and provide evidence for the claims you make.</p>
