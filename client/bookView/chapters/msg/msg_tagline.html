<p class="noindent">Writing a sample tagline is one of the best exercises you can do to make crystal clear what your positioning category is. For the purpose of this exercise, we will focus on your cake or rational value, which is the most important thing for a prospective employer or investor to understand. Examples of taglines: an engineer who is the &#x201C;Open Source Software Visionary&#x201D; or a corporate lawyer who is the &#x201C;Strategic IP Expert.&#x201D; Your tagline could be your headline for your LinkedIn profile summary.</p>
