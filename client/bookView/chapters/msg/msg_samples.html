<td valign="top" class="grcell">I believe I have the right mix of business skills and community values to lead Palo Alto into the future.<br/><br/>I share your values as a mother, wife of a business owner, and local leader on the YMCA board, PTA Council, Libraries Now!

<p class="noindent">Although Hillary kept her overarching messages the same (e.g., marriage of business skills and community values for new leadership), she tailored her evidence and examples according to her audience. For library lovers, she emphasized her founding membership in Libraries Now!, a grassroots group that worked to introduce a bond measure for improving libraries. For the school community, she stressed her PTA leadership, her role as a mother of schoolchildren and her volunteering in youth sports. Depending on your audience, you may have different elevator pitches.</p>
<p class="noindent">Gloria, a procurement director at a large global company, told me that after completing our BrandingPays program, she found herself on the train with <a id="page66" />the newly appointed chief procurement officer (her manager&#x2019;s manager). The train ride was going to be over an hour long and she knew she should take the opportunity to position herself with him. At first, she panicked. What was she going to say? But then she remembered that she had developed an elevator pitch with a value proposition for executives, and decided to try it out. Her introduction to him went well, and they talked at length about her role at the company and her ideas for instituting global best practices. Her goal was to have this senior executive know who she was and to position herself as a strategic contributor. Gloria&#x2019;s elevator pitch helped her to come across as articulate and present her role in a strategic global context. Mission accomplished!</p>
<p class="noindent">An elevator pitch will give you confidence to meet new people in any setting because you know you have talking points to use.</p>
<p class="noindent"><a href="#fig3.4">Figure 3.4</a> is an example of an elevator pitch that positions Gloria as a strategic thinker and leader with company executives.</p>

<p class="noindent">How do you use your elevator pitch at networking events? It&#x2019;s important to be yourself and to use your own words that sound natural. Remember that a conversation should not be an opportunity for you to talk nonstop about yourself. If someone asks you about yourself, say a few sentences to establish your positioning credibility, then ask the person about him- or herself. You will find opportunities throughout this give-and-take to weave in your key messages. Remember that your mission is education, not mere promotion. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What is the one key thing that people will remember about me?&#x201D; If they look at your business card after the event, will they remember that you are a purchasing exec or whatever you are, and connect with you later if they have a need in your area of expertise?</p>

<td valign="top" class="grcell">I recently helped a Fortune 500 company protect their IP interests when they spun off a technology business. I enjoy speaking to industry groups on the topic of managing the legal issues in innovation.</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p class="noindent">By setting the context for why protecting intellectual property is important to business, George will likely get asked follow-on questions probing what he means. At that point, he could bring up a recent project he worked on with a Fortune 500 company. This exchange of ideas will come across as a natural conversation and not as a sales pitch.</p>
<p><a id="page68" /></p>
<p class="noindent">However, within a few sentences, George will have positioned himself as a credible IP lawyer. People who meet him will consider recommending him as a speaker to their industry group if innovation or IP are topics of interest.</p>

<p class="noindent">Remember Lee&#x2019;s positioning example in <a href="chapter002.xhtml">chapter 2</a>? This elevator pitch is an example of how he could message his positioning value.</p>
<p class="noindent">Depending on how the conversation went, he could bring up different evidence points. The overall impression of Lee is positive because he comes across as someone who knows what he wants and how to get it. This is the type of personality that management consulting firms seek to hire.</p>
