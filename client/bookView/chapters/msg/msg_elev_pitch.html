<h2 id="h2_3"><span class="gray">The Elevator Pitch and Your Evidence</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Madeleine, a high-tech entrepreneur, was at a networking event where all participants were given 30 seconds to introduce themselves. She stood up and began to ramble about different scenarios where her product was needed. At the end of her 30 seconds, her audience couldn&#x2019;t remember what she or her company did. She missed an opportunity to brand herself and her company.</p>
<p class="noindent">What Madeleine needed was an elevator pitch, a set of talking points that would help her to answer succinctly &#x201C;What do you do?&#x201D; or &#x201C;Tell me about yourself.&#x201D;</p>
<p class="noindent">Having a set of talking points will help you take advantage of an opportunity to position yourself&#x2014;no matter where you are, even if it&#x2019;s between floors on an elevator ride.</p>
<p class="noindent">A perfect example of using an elevator pitch to take advantage of an unexpected opportunity is Jenna. Recently, she spotted a CEO of a biotech company eating alone in her local restaurant. She had worked with him briefly at her current firm when he was a senior vice president there, but she wasn&#x2019;t sure he remembered her. Armed with an elevator pitch that she had prepared in advance, she confidently introduced herself. The CEO asked her to sit down and they chatted about her current company and the industry for 15 minutes. When she rose to leave, she told him that if he ever had need for a senior corporate lawyer with strong commercial experience, she would be interested. He had her sit down again, and after another discussion, nearly offered her a job on the spot. Within two weeks, she got her dream job as an executive with this company. Jenna&#x2019;s compelling elevator pitch helped her make a favorable impression that led to a great job offer.</p>
<p class="noindent">See <a href="#fig3.1">Figure 3.1</a> for a template for developing your elevator pitch.</p>

<p class="noindent">The elevator pitch template will help you to organize your talking points into three categories:</p>
<div class="blist0">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>What I Do (or Want to Do)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Context and Value</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Evidence</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">The &#x201C;What I Do&#x201D; section should include keywords that your audience can remember after meeting you. For Hillary Freeman, the City Council candidate, the most important thing was for voters to remember her name and associate it with the City Council race. Often when I meet people, they launch into other subjects so quickly that I haven&#x2019;t caught their name and have no idea who they work for or what they do. Establish your name and what you do (or hope to do) up front.</p>
<p class="noindent">The &#x201C;Context and Value&#x201D; section should help your audience understand the importance of what you do and how you are positioning yourself. The context for Hillary was shared values and bringing city policies and community values into balance. You need to establish what is happening in the world that makes your job and ability so compelling. If we don&#x2019;t think what you do is important, it&#x2019;s unlikely your audience will pay much attention to the rest of your elevator pitch.</p>
<p class="noindent">The &#x201C;Evidence&#x201D; section should include proof points of the claims you are making.</p>
<p><a id="page63" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Hillary, for example, backs up her claim of having the &#x201C;right business skills and community values&#x201D; with her business executive and community leadership experience.</p>
<p class="noindent">It&#x2019;s important that your elevator pitch not sound like a canned speech, which can be off-putting. No one likes the feeling of being pitched by a salesperson. Try to find ways to weave elements of your elevator pitch into a conversation without sounding rehearsed or boastful.</p>
<h3><strong>Remember, the elevator pitch should be your talking points. Find creative ways of weaving them into conversations.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you have limited time to give your elevator pitch, consider this guide:</p>
<div class="fig">
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">5 seconds:</span></strong> Say your name and what you do (or want to do).</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">30 seconds:</span></strong> Add the context and your value messages.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">60 seconds or beyond:</span></strong> Add examples of your evidence. You can include examples and metrics. You might weave in some stories that highlight the points you are trying to make.</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page64" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The positioning statement should feed the messaging in your elevator pitch. See how Hillary&#x2019;s positioning statement and her elevator pitch are related in <a href="#fig3.2">Figure 3.2</a> and <a href="#fig3.3">Figure 3.3</a>.</p>
