<p class="noindent">LinkedIn has become one of the world&#x2019;s most important professional networks, and it is where many recruiters and hiring managers go to find candidates. Others will often look up your profile before meeting with you, so your LinkedIn profile may set the first impression.</p>
<p class="noindent">The positioning work in the BrandingPays System provides the basis for developing a LinkedIn profile that will set you apart in a positive way.</p>
<p class="noindent">We&#x2019;ll use Celia again as an example. How can Celia translate her positioning work into compelling copy for her LinkedIn profile?</p>
<p class="noindent">I always encourage professionals to write a headline and summary in LinkedIn before the chronological detail to position themselves for job or business opportunities. Here&#x2019;s a sample LinkedIn profile for Celia.</p>
<div class="fig">
<p class="caption1">Business Process Engineering Executive and Diversity Leader</p>
<p class="noindent">Solving complex problems and encouraging diversity hiring are two hallmarks of my leadership in business process engineering. A strong background in engineering gives me the analytical framework for simplifying complexity. As a business process engineering executive for XYZ Corporation, I built a high-performance team charged with reducing manufacturing costs. We developed 30 cost-cutting initiatives that resulted in millions of dollars in cost-savings through streamlined operations.</p>
<p class="noindent">I also enjoy being a role model for women in technology leadership. While serving as the president of a national organization for female engineers, I worked with our executive leadership to bring recognition of XYZ Corp. as a good place for women in technology.</p>
</div>
<p class="noindent">In two short paragraphs, Celia was able to communicate her positioning in business processing engineering and diversity leadership, as well as provide some high-level evidence backing up her positioning claims. She comes across as a confident, capable leader who is differentiated by her engineering <a id="page74" />background, complex problem-solving skills and diversity leadership. The fact that her profile is well written speaks to her communication skills.</p>
<p class="noindent">Your LinkedIn profile can be written in the first person (I) or third person (he or she), depending on which voice serves your story better. Although some branding experts suggest injecting your personality into your profile, my advice is to err on the side of being conservative and businesslike. A profile that raises eyebrows may damage rather than promote your chances of getting a job or a new business opportunity. A telephone call or in-person meeting provides a better channel to convey your personality.</p>
<p class="noindent">Avoid too many superlatives in your messaging. They can detract rather than add to your credibility. It is best to demonstrate your superior skills or value through evidence messages.</p>
