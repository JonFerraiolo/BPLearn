<div class='about'>
	<h3 class='aboutWelcome'>Welcome to the BrandingPays eWorkbook!</h3>
	<p>The BrandingPays eWorkbook provides an electronic step-by-step guide through 
		the BrandingPays five-step method for reinventing your personal brand.</p>
	<h4 class='aboutSection'>If you want to get started right away</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>If you have not yet read the book (<a href='http://brandingpays.com/book'>BrandingPays: The Five-Step System for Reinventing Your Personal Brand</a>), we recommend that you proceed to the "Course" tab to step through the e-Learning course.</li>
		<li>If you have already read the book, then you might want to proceed directly to the "Worksheets" tab to plan out your next big career move.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4 class='aboutSection'>Introduction to the eWorkbook's user interface</h4>
	<h5 class='aboutSubSection'>User menu at top/right</h4>
	<p>At the top/right of the user interface, you'll see "Welcome, &lt;your name&gt;", followed by the small silhouette of a person, followed by a small down arrow. The small down arrow indicates a menu - in this case, the "user menu". On the menu, you can manage your account, your eWorkbook subscription and you can log out of your current session.</p>
	<h5 class='aboutSubSection'>Top-level tabs</h4>
	<p>Note that there are four main tabs in the eWorkbook:</p>
	<div class='aboutShowTabs'></div>
	<dl>
		<dt class='mainTabsTab'>Course</dt>
		<dd>Step-by-step, interactive instruction that teaches you the BrandingPays five-step method.</dd>
		<dt class='mainTabsTab'>Worksheets</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Your personal electronic workbook, where you can use the BrandingPays methodology to plan out your next big career move.</p>
			<p>Note that, as you proceed through the interactive features within the chapters, your answers to the chapter questions will be automatically entered into your workbook.</p>
		</dd>
		<dt class='mainTabsTab'>Discussion</dt>
		<dd>Quick access to any threaded discussions you might be having with colleagues about your respective workbooks.</dd>
	</dl>
	<h5 class='aboutSubSection'>Auto-saving to the cloud</h4>
	<p>As you step through the chapters and/or enter data into your workbook, the eWorkbook will auto-save your changes to a datastore in the cloud. This means the eWorkbook will remember where you left off, and if you switch to a different device (e.g., from your laptop to your phone), you can resume where you last left off.</p>
