<p class="noindent">You are now at Branding Step 4, and are well on your way in your self-branding journey. You should now have an understanding of:</p>
<div class="blist">
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>Who you are (your assessment of yourself and other&#x2019;s perceptions)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>What unique value you provide (positioning statement)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>The desired brand to achieve your goals (brand strategy platform)</p>
<p class="blist"><span class="pbo">&bull;</span>How to represent and message your rational value, or cake, and emotional value, or icing (messages and key brand descriptors)</p>
</div>
<p><a id="page101" /></p>
<p class="noindent">Next, you have to decide who should receive your brand messages. Branding is not just about what you say, it&#x2019;s what others say about you. That&#x2019;s where the ecosystem comes into play.</p>
<p class="noindent">You have limited time and resources. You cannot talk to everyone, nor should you. You need to prioritize. Developing an ecosystem model will help you to focus on the people and organizations that will have the greatest impact on your success.</p>
