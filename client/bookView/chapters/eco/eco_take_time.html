<h2 id="h2_7"><span class="gray">Take Time for Relationship Building</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">Ellen was a typical Type A manager who was results-driven. She was so concerned about meeting deadlines that she didn&#x2019;t take the time to develop relationships&#x2014;not with her team, her colleagues or senior leadership. In fact, she admitted that her team rejoiced when she left the office because her brusque and efficient manner put them on edge. She was concerned about why others were being promoted over her, even though her accomplishments were more significant. Doing a good job is not enough, I told her, adding that shared social experiences go a long way toward building a bond of trust and likability. When we explored the role of the ecosystem and the importance of ecosystem relationships to branding, it was as if a light bulb went off in her head. &#x201C;Wow, I get it,&#x201D; she said. She realized that office social events and visits were not a waste of time, but were an important opportunity to develop relationships with colleagues in a more relaxed environment. She decided that the only way to make relationships happen was to schedule them into her calendar, which she did. Ellen raised her visibility and likability quotient with her influencers, and has since been promoted.</p>
