<h2 id="h2_5"><span class="gray">The 90/10 Rule</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The best way to establish and enhance your brand is by leveraging the power of the influencers in your brand ecosystem. Who are the influencers? Generally, 90 percent of the market is influenced by a few&#x2014;the 10 percent who we call the influencers. They are the people we trust to help us determine which doctor to choose, which person to hire and whether we should invest in a company or not. In the case of the Internet with its broad reach, the influencers could represent less than 1 percent of the market.</p>
<p class="noindent">The reason why so many companies want celebrities to promote their products is because celebrities have sway over the opinions of their many fans. Oprah Winfrey, the television celebrity and former talk-show host, has tremendous power to create demand for anything she endorses. Her recommendations have turned books into instant bestsellers. Her followers think, &#x201C;If Oprah says it&#x2019;s good, it must be.&#x201D; On the Internet, there are bloggers and trendsetters who are highly influential with their followers. Have you ever been swayed to try a product based on an Internet recommendation by a friend or a blogger you trust? I will readily try out new smartphone apps based on the opinion of a few social media friends. You are probably an influencer within a certain ecosystem sphere, even if it is only with friends and family. In certain companies, the opinions of a handful of employees can make or break reputations. Think about who the influencers are in your company or market.</p>
