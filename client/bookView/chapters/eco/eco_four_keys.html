<h2 id="h2_8"><span class="gray">Four Keys to Strong Ecosystem Relationships</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">There are four keys to making and keeping strong ecosystem relationships:</p>
<ol class="nlist">
<li>Common bond and likability</li>
<li>Two-way value</li>
<li>Ongoing communications</li>
<li>Relationship management</li>
</ol>
<p class="noindent">Let us take a more detailed look at each of these four areas.</p>
<p><a id="page113" /></p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Common Bond and Likability</span></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">You will not always be liked by or have a common bond with all of your influencers. But connecting on some level is important. I remember being seated on a plane with an entrepreneur I didn&#x2019;t know. Small talk led to a discussion of his acting hobby and my admission that I had once dabbled in theater. We had a laugh about onstage goof-ups, and then circled around to our professional backgrounds. He will now remember me not only as a branding expert but someone with whom he shared theater stories. Strong cake and icing can be a powerful mnemonic.</p>
<p class="noindent">I&#x2019;ve worked with a number of executives on personal branding who seem to think that social banter is a time waster. They are very goal-oriented and just want to &#x201C;cut to the chase&#x201D; and do business. However, they need to understand that the warm-up chat before discussing weightier topics is extremely important. Think of this social interchange as the on-ramp to the freeway of business discussions. It&#x2019;s dangerous to jump into 70-mile-an-hour traffic starting from zero without accelerating to traffic speed. During &#x201C;on-ramp&#x201D; small talk, people size each other up and decide if they like and trust their conversation partners. In France, it is considered somewhat rude to talk about business during a meal. Only after one enjoys the meal and the mealtime conversation should business enter into the equation. In other countries, the social sharing of tea or coffee might be the precursor to a business discussion. You can jeopardize your ultimate business goal by skipping the &#x201C;on-ramp.&#x201D; Learn the art of conversation and how to be engaging socially to get the most out of your ecosystem relationships.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Two-Way Value</span></strong></p>
<h3><strong>The ecosystem is about give and take. It is not a one-way street where you do all the talking and the taking.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">I remember a former colleague who asked me for a meeting to see if she should become an independent consultant. I bought her lunch, gave her some valuable tips and connected her with some others I thought could help. She went on to become a successful consultant, but I never heard back from her&#x2014;no thanks <a id="page114" />and no updates. It is doubtful that I will ever recommend her again. When the value flows in only one direction, influencers are less likely to want to help you.</p>
<p class="noindent">If you are looking for a job (<a href="#fig5.7">Figure 5.7</a>) or new business, it is fine to call on others with the hope of an introduction, a lead or helpful information. However, the relationship will be more powerful if there is a two-way exchange of value. Ask yourself, &#x201C;What value do I have to offer?&#x201D; It may be a follow-up email with an article of interest, a connection or the sharing of your expertise. Don&#x2019;t forget to close the loop to let those who have helped you know if you got the job or made the recommended connection. At the very least, make sure you thank your connections for their help.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Ongoing Communications</span></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">If influencers are important to your brand, you need to keep them briefed on your value and progress. You also need to check in to see how they are doing. If people hear from you only every couple of years, it&#x2019;s unlikely that they will know your current brand and be able to help you. Do not wait until you need something to reach out to people. Have a relationship that is based on mutual interest, not just need.</p>
<p class="noindent"><strong><span class="orange">Relationship Management</span></strong></p>
<p class="noindent">We will be talking about relationship management later in this chapter. For now, the important point is to be proactive in guiding perceptions about your brand. Successful management encompasses understanding your key influencers, developing a win/win relationship and growing the relationship over time.</p>
