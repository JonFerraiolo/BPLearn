<h2 id="h2_11"><span class="gray">A Word about Networking</span></h2>
<p class="noindent">The brand ecosystem is about building and managing an ecosystem of two-way value that helps you reach your brand goals. Why don&#x2019;t I just call it networking? Because networking can have negative connotations if it is done without a strategy and without authenticity.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many people think that the greater number of contacts through networking, the better. By some measures this is true, since you can lower the degrees of separation from your targets the more people you know. That is a driving force behind LinkedIn, the professional network. However, I would rather have a smaller number of people who know me well and who care about me than a host of people for whom I am a mere business card with no emotional connection.</p>
<p class="noindent">Think of all those business people who play golf for hours together. They are not just getting exercise, they are sharing interests, friendship and business destinies. The proverbial Old Boys&#x2019; Network, where men help their buddies in business, is very much a social club. Men seem to understand this. Women, less so. Ellen, who had the &#x201C;Ah ha!&#x201D; that she needed to develop more meaningful work relationships, finally got it and no longer viewed socializing as a waste of time.</p>
<p><a id="page118" /></p>
<p class="noindent">The purpose of too many networking events seems to be to exchange as many business cards as possible.</p>
<h3><strong>It makes sense to know a broad network of people, but the key is to develop a relationship.</strong></h3>
<p class="noindent">If you are busy doing &#x201C;speed dating&#x201D; at an event, it&#x2019;s unlikely that you&#x2019;ll develop any meaningful relationships. I encourage professionals to give of themselves without demanding or expecting anything in return. A golden phrase that everybody loves to hear is: &#x201C;How can I help you?&#x201D; If you are genuine and follow through, others will likely reciprocate.</p>
<p class="noindent">The key to networking is to be liked and to be remembered. The first is important, for as I said in <a href="chapter001.xhtml">chapter 1</a>, no one will advocate for you who doesn&#x2019;t like you. The reason why I like people may have more to do with their personalities and their presence (icing) than with their profession (cake). Do you recall my memorable experience with the entrepreneur who liked acting? My second point on being remembered is critical. If no one can associate you with something of value or interest, your business card will be tossed.</p>
<p class="noindent">Many people who are shy and lack confidence in crowds dread networking events. You&#x2019;ll usually find them in a corner with their drink, watching others have conversations. My advice is to put your focus on helping others to connect, which will help you forget about your own insecurities. Make it a point to introduce yourself to people who are off by themselves, and later connect them to someone else who might share their interests. You&#x2019;ll be a hero to them. By acting more like a host, you&#x2019;ll feel more confident and empowered.</p>
<p class="noindent">In sum, the brand ecosystem model and relationship management provide a strategic framework for focused relationship building and communications. It is much more powerful than mere networking.</p>
