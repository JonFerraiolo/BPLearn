<p class="noindent">Gloria, the procurement director from <a href="chapter003.xhtml">chapter 3</a>, was worried after her company was acquired. Her counterpart from the acquiring company began taking over functions that previously had been her group&#x2019;s responsibility. If he succeeded in his power grab, she could lose her job.</p>
<p class="noindent">Her immediate boss understood Gloria&#x2019;s value, but other influential executives did not know her well. She needed to be more visible to these executives and make her value known. She volunteered to lead the development of the strategic plan. She wanted to demonstrate her strategic leadership, and set up interviews with each of her executive stakeholders for a discussion of the key issues. At the end of each interview, she explained that ambiguity about roles and responsibilities at her level were causing internal confusion. She made her case for retaining her pre-integration role.</p>
<p class="noindent">By Gloria&#x2019;s educating the influencers, her boss heard not just from Gloria but also from other executives that her leadership role in procurement should remain unchallenged. Gloria succeeded in developing a more strategic and higher-profile brand image with executives, thereby safeguarding her job. She leveraged her internal brand ecosystem to achieve her goal.</p>
